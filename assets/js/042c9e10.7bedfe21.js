There were men ofhigh birth, accustomed to public charges at home and abroad, who hadbecome newly conspicuous not only as enemies of the Medici and friendsof popular government, but as thorough Piagnoni, espousing to theutmost the doctrines and practical teaching of the Frate, andfrequenting San Marco as the seat of another Samuel: some of them menof authoritative and handsome presence, like Francesco Valori, andperhaps also of a hot and arrogant temper, very much gratified by animmediate divine authority for bringing about freedom in their own way;others, like Soderini, with less of the ardent Piagnone, and more ofthe wise politician. There were men, also of family, like PieroCapponi, simply brave undoctrinal lovers of a sober republican liberty,who preferred fighting to arguing, and had no particular reasons forthinking any ideas false that kept out the Medici and made room forpublic spirit. At their elbows were doctors of law whose studies ofAccursius and his brethren had not so entirely consumed their ardour asto prevent them from becoming enthusiastic Piagnoni: Messer LucaCorsini himself, for example, who on a memorable occasion yet to comewas to raise his learned arms in street stone-throwing for the cause ofreligion, freedom, and the Frate. And among the dignities who carriedtheir black lucco or furred mantle with an air of habitual authority,there was an abundant sprinkling of men with more contemplative andsensitive faces: scholars inheriting such high names as Strozzi andAcciajoli, who were already minded to take the cowl and join thecommunity of San Marco; artists, wrought to a new and higher ambitionby the teaching of Savonarola, like that young painter who had latelysurpassed himself in his fresco of the divine child on the wall of theFrate\u2019s bare cell\u2014unconscious yet that he would one day himself wearthe tonsure and the cowl, and be called Fra Bartolommeo. There was themystic poet Girolamo Benevieni hastening, perhaps, to carry tidings ofthe beloved Frate\u2019s speedy coming to his friend Pico della Mirandola,who was never to see the light of another morning. There were well-bornwomen attired with such scrupulous plainness that their more refinedgrace was the chief distinction between them and their lessaristocratic sisters. There was a predominant proportion of the genuine",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"popolani")," or middle class, belonging both to the Major and Minor Arts,conscious of purses threatened by war-taxes. And more striking andvarious, perhaps, than all the other classes of the Frate\u2019s disciples,there was the long stream of poorer tradesmen and artisans, whose faithand hope in his Divine message varied from the rude andundiscriminating trust in him as the friend of the poor and the enemyof the luxurious oppressive rich, to that eager tasting of all thesubtleties of biblical interpretation which takes a peculiarly stronghold on the sedentary artisan, illuminating the long dim spaces beyondthe board where he stitches, with a pale flame that seems to him thelight of Divine science."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"But among these various disciples of the Frate were scattered many whowere not in the least his disciples. Some were Mediceans who hadalready, from motives of fear and policy, begun to show the presidingspirit of the popular party a feigned deference. Others were sincereadvocates of a free government, but regarded Savonarola simply as anambitious monk\u2014half sagacious, half fanatical\u2014who had made himself apowerful instrument with the people, and must be accepted as animportant social fact. There were even some of his bitter enemies:members of the old aristocratic anti-Medicean party\u2014determined to tryand get the reins once more tight in the hands of certain chieffamilies; or else licentious young men, who detested him as the killjoyof Florence. For the sermons in the Duomo had already become politicalincidents, attracting the ears of curiosity and malice, as well as offaith. The men of ideas, like young Niccol\xf2 Macchiavelli, went toobserve and write reports to friends away in country villas; the men ofappetites, like Dolfo Spini, bent on hunting down the Frate, as apublic nuisance who made game scarce, went to feed their hatred and liein wait for grounds of accusation."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Perhaps, while no preacher ever had a more massive influence thanSavonarola, no preacher ever had more heterogeneous materials to workupon. And one secret of the massive influence lay in the highly mixedcharacter of his preaching. Baldassarre, wrought into an ecstasy ofself-martyring revenge, was only an extreme case among the partial andnarrow sympathies of that audience. In Savonarola\u2019s preaching therewere strains that appealed to the very finest susceptibilities of men\u2019snatures, and there were elements that gratified low egoism, tickledgossiping curiosity, and fascinated timorous superstition. His need ofpersonal predominance, his labyrinthine allegorical interpretations ofthe Scriptures, his enigmatic visions, and his false certitude aboutthe Divine intentions, never ceased, in his own large soul, to beennobled by that fervid piety, that passionate sense of the infinite,that active sympathy, that clear-sighted demand for the subjection ofselfish interests to the general good, which he had in common with thegreatest of mankind. But for the mass of his audience all the pregnancyof his preaching lay in his strong assertion of supernatural claims, inhis denunciatory visions, in the false certitude which gave his sermonsthe interest of a political bulletin; and having once held thataudience in his mastery, it was necessary to his nature\u2014it wasnecessary for their welfare\u2014that he should ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"keep")," the mastery.
