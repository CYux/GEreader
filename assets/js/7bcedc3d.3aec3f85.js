As he had recovered his strength of body, he had recoveredhis self-command and the energy of his will; he had recovered thememory of all that part of his life which was closely enwrought withhis emotions; and he had felt more and more constantly and painfullythe uneasy sense of lost knowledge.

Hehad repeated the words \u201cBratti Ferravecchi\u201d so constantly after theyhad been uttered to him, that they never slipped from him for longtogether.

This discovery had caused a violent agitation inBaldassarre. Until then he had clung with all the tenacity of hisfervent nature to his faith in Tito, and had not for a moment believedhimself to be wilfully forsaken. At first he had said, \u201cMy bit ofparchment has never reached him; that is why I am still toiling atAntioch. But he is searching; he knows where I was lost: he will traceme out, and find me at last.\u201d Then, when he was taken to Corinth, heinduced his owners, by the assurance that he should be sought out andransomed, to provide securely against the failure of any inquiries thatmight be made about him at Antioch; and at Corinth he thought joyfully,\u201cHere, at last, he must find me. Here he is sure to touch, whicheverway he goes.\u201d But before another year had passed, the illness had comefrom which he had risen with body and mind so shattered that he wasworse than worthless to his owners, except for the sake of the ransomthat did not come. Then, as he sat helpless in the morning sunlight, hebegan to think, \u201cTito has been drowned, or they have made ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"him")," aprisoner too. I shall see him no more. He set out after me, butmisfortune overtook him. I shall see his face no more.\u201d Sitting in hisnew feebleness and despair, supporting his head between his hands, withblank eyes and lips that moved uncertainly, he looked so much like ahopelessly imbecile old man, that his owners were contented to be ridof him, and allowed a Genoese merchant, who had compassion on him as anItalian, to take him on board his galley. In a voyage of many months inthe Archipelago and along the seaboard of Asia Minor, Baldassarre hadrecovered his bodily strength, but on landing at Genoa he had so wearya sense of his desolateness that he almost wished he had died of thatillness at Corinth. There was just one possibility that hindered thewish from being decided: it was that Tito might not be dead, but livingin a state of imprisonment or destitution; and if he lived, there wasstill a hope for Baldassarre\u2014faint, perhaps, and likely to be longdeferred, but still a hope, that he might find his child, his cherishedson again; might yet again clasp hands and meet face to face with theone being who remembered him as he had been before his mind was broken.In this state of feeling he had chanced to meet the stranger who woreTito\u2019s onyx ring, and though Baldassarre would have been unable todescribe the ring beforehand, the sight of it stirred the dormantfibres, and he recognised it. That Tito nearly a year after his fatherhad been parted from him should have been living in apparent prosperityat Florence, selling the gem which he ought not to have sold till thelast extremity, was a fact that Baldassarre shrank from trying toaccount for: he was glad to be stunned and bewildered by it, ratherthan to have any distinct thought; he tried to feel nothing but joythat he should behold Tito again.

But the primary need and hope was to see a slowrevenge under the same sky and on the same earth where he himself hadbeen forsaken and had fainted with despair.
