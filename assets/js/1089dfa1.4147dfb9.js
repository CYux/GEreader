The Franciscans had entered and taken theirplaces in silence. But now, at the other side of the Piazza was heardloud chanting from two hundred voices, and there was generalsatisfaction, if not in the chanting, at least in the evidence that theDominicans were come. That loud chanting repetition of the prayer, \u201cLetGod arise, and let His enemies be scattered,\u201d was unpleasantlysuggestive to some impartial ears of a desire to vaunt confidence andexcite dismay; and so was the flame-coloured velvet cope in which FraDomenico was arrayed as he headed the procession, cross in hand, hissimple mind really exalted with faith, and with the genuine intentionto enter the flames for the glory of God and Fra Girolamo. Behind himcame Savonarola in the white vestment of a priest, carrying in hishands a vessel containing the consecrated Host. He, too, was chantingloudly; he, too, looked firm and confident, and as all eyes were turnedeagerly on him, either in anxiety, curiosity, or malignity, from themoment when he entered the Piazza till he mounted the steps of theLoggia and deposited the Sacrament on the altar, there was anintensifying flash and energy in his countenance responding to thatscrutiny."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"We are so made, almost all of us, that the false seeming which we havethought of with painful shrinking when beforehand in our solitude ithas urged itself on us as a necessity, will possess our muscles andmove our lips as if nothing but that were easy when once we have comeunder the stimulus of expectant eyes and ears. And the strength of thatstimulus to Savonarola can hardly be measured by the experience ofordinary lives. Perhaps no man has ever had a mighty influence over hisfellows without having the innate need to dominate, and this needusually becomes the more imperious in proportion as the complicationsof life make Self inseparable from a purpose which is not selfish. Inthis way it came to pass that on the day of the Trial by Fire, thedoubleness which is the pressing temptation in every public career,whether of priest, orator, or statesman, was more strongly defined inSavonarola\u2019s consciousness as the acting of a part, than at any otherperiod in his life.

It was a commonturning-point towards which those widely-sundered lives had beenconverging, that two evenings ago the news had come that the Florentinecourier of the Ten had been arrested and robbed of all his despatches,so that Savonarola\u2019s letter was already in the hands of the Duke ofMilan, and would soon be in the hands of the Pope, not only heighteningrage, but giving a new justification to extreme measures. There was nomalignity in Tito Melema\u2019s satisfaction: it was the mildself-gratulation of a man who has won a game that has employedhypothetic skill, not a game that has stirred the muscles and heatedthe blood. Of course that bundle of desires and contrivances calledhuman nature, when moulded into the form of a plain-featured FratePredicatore, more or less of an impostor, could not be a patheticobject to a brilliant-minded scholar who understood everything. Yetthis tonsured Girolamo with the high nose and large under lip was animmensely clever Frate, mixing with his absurd superstitions orfabrications very remarkable notions about government: no babbler, buta man who could keep his secrets. Tito had no more spite against himthan against Saint Dominic. On the contrary, Fra Girolamo\u2019s existencehad been highly convenient to Tito Melema, furnishing him with thatround of the ladder from which he was about to leap on to a new andsmooth footing very much to his heart\u2019s content.
