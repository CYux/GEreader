She was thrownback again on the conflict between the demands of an outward law, whichshe recognised as a widely-ramifying obligation, and the demands ofinner moral facts which were becoming more and more peremptory. She haddrunk in deeply the spirit of that teaching by which Savonarola hadurged her to return to her place. She felt that the sanctity attachedto all close relations, and, therefore, pre-eminently to the closest,was but the expression in outward law of that result towards which allhuman goodness and nobleness must spontaneously tend; that the lightabandonment of ties, whether inherited or voluntary, because they hadceased to be pleasant, was the uprooting of social and personal virtue.What else had Tito\u2019s crime towards Baldassarre been but thatabandonment working itself out to the most hideous extreme of falsityand ingratitude?"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"And the inspiring consciousness breathed into her by Savonarola\u2019sinfluence that her lot was vitally united with the general lot hadexalted even the minor details of obligation into religion.

She had stoodlong; she had striven hard to fulfil the bond, but she had seen all theconditions which made the fulfilment possible gradually forsaking her.The one effect of her marriage-tie seemed to be the stiflingpredominance over her of a nature that she despised. All her efforts atunion had only made its impossibility more palpable, and the relationhad become for her simply a degrading servitude. The law was sacred.Yes, but rebellion might be sacred too. It flashed upon her mind thatthe problem before her was essentially the same as that which had lainbefore Savonarola\u2014the problem where the sacredness of obedience ended,and where the sacredness of rebellion began. To her, as to him, therehad come one of those moments in life when the soul must dare to act onits own warrant, not only without external law to appeal to, but in theface of a law which is not unarmed with Divine lightnings\u2014lightningsthat may yet fall if the warrant has been false."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Before the sun had gone down she had adopted a resolve.
