The secretary was a vain and pompous man,but he was also an honest one: he was sincerely convinced of his ownmerit, and could see no reason for feigning. The topmost round of hisazure ladder had been reached by this time: he had held hissecretaryship these twenty years\u2014had long since made his orations onthe ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"ringhiera"),", or platform of the Old Palace, as the custom was, inthe presence of princely visitors, while Marzocco, the republican lion,wore his gold crown on the occasion, and all the people cried, \u201cVivaMesser Bartolommeo!\u201d\u2014had been on an embassy to Rome, and had there beenmade titular Senator, Apostolical Secretary, Knight of the Golden Spur;and had, eight years ago, been Gonfaloniere\u2014last goal of the Florentinecitizen\u2019s ambition. Meantime he had got richer and richer, and more andmore gouty, after the manner of successful mortality; and the Knight ofthe Golden Spur had often to sit with helpless cushioned heel under thehandsome loggia he had built for himself, overlooking the spaciousgardens and lawn at the back of his palace."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"He was in this position on the day when he had granted the desiredinterview to Tito Melema. The May afternoon sun was on the flowers andthe grass beyond the pleasant shade of the loggia; the too stately silklucco was cast aside, and the light loose mantle was thrown over histunic; his beautiful daughter Alessandra and her husband, the Greeksoldier-poet Marullo, were seated on one side of him: on the other, twofriends not oppressively illustrious, and therefore the betterlisteners. Yet, to say nothing of the gout, Messer Bartolommeo\u2019sfelicity was far from perfect: it was embittered by the contents ofcertain papers that lay before him, consisting chiefly of acorrespondence between himself and Politian. It was a human foible atthat period (incredible as it may seem) to recite quarrels, and favourscholarly visitors with the communication of an entire and lengthycorrespondence; and this was neither the first nor the second time thatScala had asked the candid opinion of his friends as to the balance ofright and wrong in some half-score Latin letters between himself andPolitian, all springing out of certain epigrams written in the mostplayful tone in the world. It was the story of a very typical andpretty quarrel, in which we are interested, because it suppliedprecisely that thistle of hatred necessary, according to Nello, as astimulus to the sluggish paces of the cautious steed, Friendship.Politian, having been a rejected pretender to the love and the hand ofScala\u2019s daughter, kept a very sharp and learned tooth in readinessagainst the too prosperous and presumptuous secretary, who had declinedthe greatest scholar of the age for a son-in-law. Scala was ameritorious public servant, and, moreover, a lucky man\u2014naturallyexasperating to an offended scholar; but then\u2014O beautiful balance ofthings!\u2014he had an itch for authorship, and was a bad writer\u2014one ofthose excellent people who, sitting in gouty slippers, \u201cpenned poeticaltrifles\u201d entirely for their own amusement, without any view to anaudience, and, consequently, sent them to their friends in letters,which were the literary periodicals of the fifteenth century. Now Scalahad abundance of friends who were ready to praise his writings: friendslike Ficino and Landino\u2014amiable browsers in the Medicean park alongwith himself\u2014who found his Latin prose style elegant and masculine; andthe terrible Joseph Scaliger, who was to pronounce him totally ignorantof Latinity, was at a comfortable distance in the next century. Butwhen was the fatal coquetry inherent in superfluous authorship everquite contented with the ready praise of friends? That criticalsupercilious Politian\u2014a fellow-browser, who was far from amiable\u2014mustbe made aware that the solid secretary showed, in his leisure hours, apleasant fertility in verses, which indicated pretty clearly how muchhe might do in that way if he were not a man of affairs."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Ineffable moment! when the man you secretly hate sends you a Latinepigram with a false gender\u2014hendecasyllables with a questionableelision, at least a toe too much\u2014attempts at poetic figures which aremanifest solecisms. That moment had come to Politian: the secretary hadput forth his soft head from the official shell, and the terriblelurking crab was down upon him. Politian had used the freedom of afriend, and pleasantly, in the form of a Latin epigram, corrected themistake of Scala in making the ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"culex")," (an insect too well-known on thebanks of the Arno) of the inferior or feminine gender. Scala replied bya bad joke, in suitable Latin verses, referring to Politian\u2019sunsuccessful suit. Better and better. Politian found the verses verypretty and highly facetious: the more was the pity that they wereseriously incorrect, and inasmuch as Scala had alleged that he hadwritten them in imitation of a Greek epigram, Politian, being on suchfriendly terms, would enclose a Greek epigram of his own, on the sameinteresting insect\u2014not, we may presume, out of any wish to humbleScala, but rather to instruct him; said epigram containing a livelyconceit about Venus, Cupid, and the ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"culex"),", of a kind much tasted atthat period, founded partly on the zoological fact that the gnat, likeVenus, was born from the waters. Scala, in reply, begged to say thathis verses were never intended for a scholar with such delicateolfactories as Politian, nearest of all living men to the perfection ofthe ancients, and of a taste so fastidious that sturgeon itself mustseem insipid to him; defended his own verses, nevertheless, thoughindeed they were written hastily, without correction, and intended asan agreeable distraction during the summer heat to himself and suchfriends as were satisfied with mediocrity, he, Scala, not being likesome other people, who courted publicity through the booksellers. Forthe rest, he had barely enough Greek to make out the sense of theepigram so graciously sent him, to say nothing of tasting itselegances; but\u2014the epigram was Politian\u2019s: what more need be said?Still, by way of postscript, he feared that his incomparable friend\u2019scomparison of the gnat to Venus, on account of its origin from thewaters, was in many ways ticklish. On the one hand, Venus might beoffended; and on the other, unless the poet intended an allusion to thedoctrine of Thales, that cold and damp origin seemed doubtful to Scalain the case of a creature so fond of warmth; a fish were perhaps thebetter comparison, or, when the power of flying was in question, aneagle, or indeed, when the darkness was taken into consideration, a bator an owl were a less obscure and more apposite parallel, etcetera,etcetera. Here was a great opportunity for Politian. He was not aware,he wrote, that when he had Scala\u2019s verses placed before him, there wasany question of sturgeon, but rather of frogs and gudgeons: made shortwork with Scala\u2019s defence of his own Latin, and mangled him terribly onthe score of the stupid criticisms he had ventured on the Greek epigramkindly forwarded to him as a model. Wretched cavils, indeed! for as tothe damp origin of the gnat, there was the authority of Virgil himself,who had called it the \u201c",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"alumnus")," of the waters;\u201d and as to what hisdear dull friend had to say about the fish, the eagle, and the rest, itwas \u201cnihil ad rem;\u201d for because the eagle could fly higher, it by nomeans followed that the gnat could not fly at all, etcetera, etcetera.He was ashamed, however, to dwell on such trivialities, and thus toswell a gnat into an elephant; but, for his own part, would only addthat he had nothing deceitful or double about him, neither was he to becaught when present by the false blandishments of those who slanderedhim in his absence, agreeing rather with a Homeric sentiment on thathead\u2014which furnished a Greek quotation to serve as powder to hisbullet."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The quarrel could not end there. The logic could hardly get worse, butthe secretary got more pompously self-asserting, and the scholarlypoet\u2019s temper more and more venomous. Politian had been generouslywilling to hold up a mirror, by which the too-inflated secretary,beholding his own likeness, might be induced to cease setting up hisignorant defences of bad Latin against ancient authorities whom theconsent of centuries had placed beyond question,\u2014unless, indeed, he haddesigned to sink in literature in proportion as he rose in honours,that by a sort of compensation men of letters might feel themselves hisequals.

And as to the honours which wereoffensive to the envious, they had been well earned: witness his wholelife since he came in penury to Florence. The elegant scholar, inreply, was not surprised that Scala found the Age distasteful to him,since he himself was so distasteful to the Age; nay, it was withperfect accuracy that he, the elegant scholar, had called Scala abranny monster, inasmuch as he was formed from the off-scourings ofmonsters, born amidst the refuse of a mill, and eminently worthy thelong-eared office of turning the paternal millstones (",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"in pistrinisordibus natus et quidem pistrino dignissimus"),")!"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"It was not without reference to Tito\u2019s appointed visit that the paperscontaining this correspondence were brought out to-day.
