For Romola could not carry from dayto day into the abodes of pestilence and misery the sublime excitementof a gladness that, since such anguish existed, she too existed to makesome of the anguish less bitter, without remembering that she owed thistranscendent moral life to Fra Girolamo. She could not witness thesilencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the greatmass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in hissuperstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make theChristian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to hisside."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Far on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeksarrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo.

The question where the duty of obedienceends, and the duty of resistance begins, could in no case be an easyone; but it was made overwhelmingly difficult by the belief that theChurch was\u2014not a compromise of parties to secure a more or lessapproximate justice in the appropriation of funds, but\u2014a livingorganism, instinct with Divine power to bless and to curse. To most ofthe pious Florentines, who had hitherto felt no doubt in theiradherence to the Frate, that belief in the Divine potency of the Churchwas not an embraced opinion, it was an inalienable impression, like theconcavity of the blue firmament; and the boldness of Savonarola\u2019swritten arguments that the Excommunication was unjust, and that, beingunjust, it was not valid, only made them tremble the more, as adefiance cast at a mystic image, against whose subtle immeasurablepower there was neither weapon nor defence."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"But Romola, whose mind had not been allowed to draw its earlynourishment from the traditional associations of the Christiancommunity in which her father had lived a life apart, felt her relationto the Church only through Savonarola; his moral force had been theonly authority to which she had bowed; and in his excommunication sheonly saw the menace of hostile vice: on one side she saw a man whoselife was devoted to the ends of public virtue and spiritual purity, andon the other the assault of alarmed selfishness, headed by a lustful,greedy, lying, and murderous old man, once called Rodrigo Borgia, andnow lifted to the pinnacle of infamy as Pope Alexander the Sixth. Thefiner shades of fact which soften the edge of such antitheses are notapt to be seen except by neutrals, who are not distressed to discernsome folly in martyrs and some judiciousness in the men who burnt them.But Romola required a strength that neutrality could not give; and thisExcommunication, which simplified and ennobled the resistant positionof Savonarola by bringing into prominence its wider relations, seemedto come to her like a rescue from the threatening isolation ofcriticism and doubt. The Frate was now withdrawn from that smallerantagonism against Florentine enemies into which he continually fell inthe unchecked excitement of the pulpit, and presented himself simply asappealing to the Christian world against a vicious exercise ofecclesiastical power. He was a standard-bearer leaping into the breach.Life never seems so clear and easy as when the heart is beating fasterat the sight of some generous self-risking deed. We feel no doubt thenwhat is the highest prize the soul can win; we almost believe in ourown power to attain it. By a new current of such enthusiasm Romola washelped through these difficult summer days. She had ventured on nowords to Tito that would apprise him of her late interview withBaldassarre, and the revelation he had made to her. What would suchagitating, difficult words win from him? No admission of the truth;nothing, probably, but a cool sarcasm about her sympathy with hisassassin. Baldassarre was evidently helpless: the thing to be fearedwas, not that he should injure Tito, but that Tito, coming upon histraces, should carry out some new scheme for ridding himself of theinjured man who was a haunting dread to him. Romola felt that she coulddo nothing decisive until she had seen Baldassarre again, and learnedthe full truth about that \u201cother wife\u201d\u2014learned whether she were thewife to whom Tito was first bound."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The possibilities about that other wife, which involved the worst woundto her hereditary pride, mingled themselves as a newly-embitteringsuspicion with the earliest memories of her illusory love, eating awaythe lingering associations of tenderness with the past image of herhusband; and her irresistible belief in the rest of Baldassarre\u2019srevelation made her shrink from Tito with a horror which would perhapshave urged some passionate speech in spite of herself if he had notbeen more than usually absent from home. Like many of the wealthiercitizens in that time of pestilence, he spent the intervals of businesschiefly in the country: the agreeable Melema was welcome at manyvillas, and since Romola had refused to leave the city, he had no needto provide a country residence of his own."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"But at last, in the later days of July, the alleviation of those publictroubles which had absorbed her activity and much of her thought, leftRomola to a less counteracted sense of her personal lot. The Plague hadalmost disappeared, and the position of Savonarola was made morehopeful by a favourable magistracy, who were writing urgent vindicatoryletters to Rome on his behalf, entreating the withdrawal of theExcommunication."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Romola\u2019s healthy and vigorous frame was undergoing the reaction oflanguor inevitable after continuous excitement and over-exertion; buther mental restlessness would not allow her to remain at home withoutperemptory occupation, except during the sultry hours. In the cool ofthe morning and evening she walked out constantly, varying herdirection as much as possible, with the vague hope that if Baldassarrewere still alive she might encounter him. Perhaps some illness hadbrought a new paralysis of memory, and he had forgotten where shelived\u2014forgotten even her existence. That was her most sanguineexplanation of his non-appearance.
