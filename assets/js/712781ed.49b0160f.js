For it was shadedfrom the light above by overhanging branches and wreaths of flowers,and the fresh tapers below it were unlit. But it seemed that thedecoration of the altar and its recess was not complete. For part ofthe floor was strewn with a confusion of flowers and green boughs, andamong them sat a delicate blue-eyed girl of thirteen, tossing her longlight-brown hair out of her eyes, as she made selections for thewreaths she was weaving, or looked up at her mother\u2019s work in the samekind, and told her how to do it with a little air of instruction."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"For that mother was not very clever at weaving flowers or at any otherwork.

She still woreher contadina gown: it was only broader than the old one; and there wasthe silver pin in her rough curly brown hair, and round her neck thememorable necklace, with a red cord under it, that ended mysteriouslyin her bosom. Her rounded face wore even a more perfect look ofchildish content than in her younger days: everybody was so good in theworld, Tessa thought; even Monna Brigida never found fault with hernow, and did little else than sleep, which was an amiable practice ineverybody, and one that Tessa liked for herself."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Monna Brigida was asleep at this moment, in a straight-backedarm-chair, a couple of yards off.
