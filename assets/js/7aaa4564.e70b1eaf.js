Thegreat bell in the palace tower had rung out the hammer-sound of alarm,and the people had mustered with their rusty arms, their tools andimpromptu cudgels, to drive out the Medici. The gate of San Gallo hadbeen fairly shut on the arrogant, exasperating Piero, galloping awaytowards Bologna with his hired horsemen frightened behind him, and shuton his keener young brother, the cardinal, escaping in the disguise ofa Franciscan monk: a price had been set on both their heads. Afterthat, there had been some sacking of houses, according to oldprecedent; the ignominious images, painted on the public buildings, ofthe men who had conspired against the Medici in days gone by, wereeffaced; the exiled enemies of the Medici were invited home. Thehalf-fledged tyrants were fairly out of their splendid nest in the ViaLarga, and the Republic had recovered the use of its will again."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"But now, a week later, the great palace in the Via Larga had beenprepared for the reception of another tenant; and if drapery roofingthe streets with unwonted colour, if banners and hangings pouring outof the windows, if carpets and tapestry stretched over all steps andpavement on which exceptional feet might tread, were an unquestionableproof of joy, Florence was very joyful in the expectation of its newguest. The stream of colour flowed from the palace in the Via Largaround by the Cathedral, then by the great Piazza della Signoria, andacross the Ponte Vecchio to the Porta San Frediano\u2014the gate that lookstowards Pisa. There, near the gate, a platform and canopy had beenerected for the Signoria; and Messer Luca Corsini, doctor of law, felthis heart palpitating a little with the sense that he had a Latinoration to read; and every chief elder in Florence had to make himselfready, with smooth chin and well-lined silk lucco, to walk inprocession; and the well-born youths were looking at their rich newtunics after the French mode which was to impress the stranger ashaving a peculiar grace when worn by Florentines; and a large body ofthe clergy, from the archbishop in his effulgence to the train ofmonks, black, white, and grey, were consulting betimes in the morninghow they should marshal themselves, with their burden of relics andsacred banners and consecrated jewels, that their movements might beadjusted to the expected arrival of the illustrious visitor, at threeo\u2019clock in the afternoon."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"An unexampled visitor! For he had come through the passes of the Alpswith such an army as Italy had not seen before: with thousands ofterrible Swiss, well used to fight for love and hatred as well as forhire; with a host of gallant cavaliers proud of a name; with anunprecedented infantry, in which every man in a hundred carried anarquebus; nay, with cannon of bronze, shooting not stones but ironballs, drawn not by bullocks but by horses, and capable of firing asecond time before a city could mend the breach made by the first ball.Some compared the new-comer to Charlemagne, reputed rebuilder ofFlorence, welcome conqueror of degenerate kings, regulator andbenefactor of the Church; some preferred the comparison to Cyrus,liberator of the chosen people, restorer of the Temple. For he had comeacross the Alps with the most glorious projects: he was to marchthrough Italy amidst the jubilees of a grateful and admiring people; hewas to satisfy all conflicting complaints at Rome; he was to takepossession, by virtue of hereditary right and a little fighting, of thekingdom of Naples; and from that convenient starting-point he was toset out on the conquest of the Turks, who were partly to be cut topieces and partly converted to the faith of Christ. It was a schemethat seemed to befit the Most Christian King, head of a nation which,thanks to the devices of a subtle Louis the Eleventh who had died inmuch fright as to his personal prospects ten years before, had becomethe strongest of Christian monarchies; and this antitype of Cyrus andCharlemagne was no other than the son of that subtle Louis\u2014the youngCharles the Eighth of France."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Surely, on a general statement, hardly anything could seem moregrandiose, or fitter to revive in the breasts of men the memory ofgreat dispensations by which new strata had been laid in the history ofmankind.

It was aconviction that rested less on the necessarily momentous character of apowerful foreign invasion than on certain moral emotions to which theaspect of the times gave the form of presentiments: emotions which hadfound a very remarkable utterance in the voice of a single man."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"That man was Fra Girolamo Savonarola, Prior of the Dominican convent ofSan Marco in Florence. On a September morning, when men\u2019s ears wereringing with the news that the French army had entered Italy, he hadpreached in the Cathedral of Florence from the text, \u201cBehold I, even I,do bring a flood of waters upon the earth.\u201d He believed it was bysupreme guidance that he had reached just so far in his exposition ofGenesis the previous Lent; and he believed the \u201cflood of water\u201d\u2014emblemat once of avenging wrath and purifying mercy\u2014to be thedivinely\u2014indicated symbol of the French army. His audience, some ofwhom were held to be among the choicest spirits of the age\u2014the mostcultivated men in the most cultivated of Italian cities\u2014believed ittoo, and listened with shuddering awe. For this man had a power rarelyparalleled, of impressing his beliefs on others, and of swaying veryvarious minds. And as long as four years ago he had proclaimed from thechief pulpit of Florence that a scourge was about to descend on Italy,and that by this scourge the Church was to be purified. Savonarolaappeared to believe, and his hearers more or less waveringly believed,that he had a mission like that of the Hebrew prophets, and that theFlorentines amongst whom his message was delivered were in some sense asecond chosen people. The idea of prophetic gifts was not a remote onein that age: seers of visions, circumstantial heralds of things to be,were far from uncommon either outside or inside the cloister; but thisvery fact made Savonarola stand out the more conspicuously as a grandexception. While in others the gift of prophecy was very much like afarthing candle illuminating small corners of human destiny withprophetic gossip, in Savonarola it was like a mighty beacon shining farout for the warning and guidance of men. And to some of the soberestminds the supernatural character of his insight into the futuregathered a strong attestation from the peculiar conditions of the age."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"At the close of 1492, the year in which Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici died andTito Melema came as a wanderer to Florence, Italy was enjoying a peaceand prosperity unthreatened by any near and definite danger. There wasno fear of famine, for the seasons had been plenteous in corn, andwine, and oil; new palaces had been rising in all fair cities, newvillas on pleasant slopes and summits; and the men who had more thantheir share of these good things were in no fear of the larger numberwho had less. For the citizens\u2019 armour was getting rusty, andpopulations seemed to have become tame, licking the hands of masterswho paid for a ready-made army when they wanted it, as they paid forgoods of Smyrna. Even the fear of the Turk had ceased to be active, andthe Pope found it more immediately profitable to accept bribes from himfor a little prospective poisoning than to form plans either forconquering or for converting him."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Altogether this world, with its partitioned empire and its roomyuniversal Church, seemed to be a handsome establishment for the few whowere lucky or wise enough to reap the advantages of human folly: aworld in which lust and obscenity, lying and treachery, oppression andmurder, were pleasant, useful, and when properly managed, notdangerous. And as a sort of fringe or adornment to the substantialdelights of tyranny, avarice, and lasciviousness, there was thepatronage of polite learning and the fine arts, so that flattery couldalways be had in the choicest Latin to be commanded at that time, andsublime artists were at hand to paint the holy and the unclean withimpartial skill. The Church, it was said, had never been so disgracedin its head, had never shown so few signs of renovating, vital beliefin its lower members; nevertheless it was much more prosperous than insome past days. The heavens were fair and smiling above; and belowthere were no signs of earthquake."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Yet at that time, as we have seen, there was a man in Florence who fortwo years and more had been preaching that a scourge was at hand; thatthe world was certainly not framed for the lasting convenience ofhypocrites, libertines, and oppressors. From the midst of those smilingheavens he had seen a sword hanging\u2014the sword of God\u2019s justice\u2014whichwas speedily to descend with purifying punishment on the Church and theworld. In brilliant Ferrara, seventeen years before, the contradictionbetween men\u2019s lives and their professed beliefs had pressed upon himwith a force that had been enough to destroy his appetite for theworld, and at the age of twenty-three had driven him into the cloister.He believed that God had committed to the Church the sacred lamp oftruth for the guidance and salvation of men, and he saw that theChurch, in its corruption, had become a sepulchre to hide the lamp. Asthe years went on scandals increased and multiplied, and hypocrisyseemed to have given place to impudence. Had the world, then, ceased tohave a righteous Ruler? Was the Church finally forsaken? No, assuredly:in the Sacred Book there was a record of the past in which might beseen as in a glass what would be in the days to come, and the bookshowed that when the wickedness of the chosen people, type of theChristian Church, had become crying, the judgments of God had descendedon them. Nay, reason itself declared that vengeance was imminent, forwhat else would suffice to turn men from their obstinacy in evil? Andunless the Church were reclaimed, how could the promises be fulfilled,that the heathens should be converted and the whole world becomesubject to the one true law? He had seen his belief reflected invisions\u2014a mode of seeing which had been frequent with him from hisyouth up."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"But the real force of demonstration for Girolamo Savonarola lay in hisown burning indignation at the sight of wrong; in his fervent belief inan Unseen Justice that would put an end to the wrong, and in an UnseenPurity to which lying and uncleanness were an abomination.

Ambassadors\u2014\u201corators,\u201d as theywere called in those haranguing times\u2014went and came; a recusantcardinal, determined not to acknowledge a Pope elected by bribery (andhis own particular enemy), went and came also, and seconded theinvitation with hot rhetoric; and the young king seemed to lend awilling ear. So that in 1493 the rumour spread and became louder andlouder that Charles the Eighth of France was about to cross the Alpswith a mighty army; and the Italian populations, accustomed, sinceItaly had ceased to be the heart of the Roman empire, to look for anarbitrator from afar, began vaguely to regard his coming as a means ofavenging their wrongs and redressing their grievances."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"And in that rumour Savonarola had heard the assurance that his prophecywas being verified. What was it that filled the ears of the prophets ofold but the distant tread of foreign armies, coming to do the work ofjustice?

The French army was that newdeluge which was to purify the earth from iniquity; the French king,Charles the Eighth, was the instrument elected by God, as Cyrus hadbeen of old, and all men who desired good rather than evil were torejoice in his coming.

He held their strong frontierfortresses, which Piero de\u2019 Medici had given up to him without securingany honourable terms in return; he had done nothing to quell thealarming revolt of Pisa, which had been encouraged by his presence tothrow off the Florentine yoke; and \u201corators,\u201d even with a prophet attheir head, could win no assurance from him, except that he wouldsettle everything when he was once within the walls of Florence.
