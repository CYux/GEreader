It was still possible\u2014perhaps it might beinevitable\u2014for him to accept frankly the altered conditions, and avowBaldassarre\u2019s existence; but hardly without casting an unpleasant lightbackward on his original reticence as studied equivocation in order toavoid the fulfilment of a secretly recognised claim, to say nothing ofhis quiet settlement of himself and investment of his florins, when, itwould be clear, his benefactor\u2019s fate had not been certified.

Tito hadnever had occasion to fabricate an ingenious lie before: the occasionwas come now\u2014the occasion which circumstance never fails to beget ontacit falsity; and his ingenuity was ready.

Those ideas had all been sown in the fresh soil of Tito\u2019smind, and were lively germs there: that was the proper order ofthings\u2014the order of nature, which treats all maturity as a mere nidusfor youth.

After a long voyage, to spend months,perhaps years, in a search for which even now there was no guaranteethat it would not prove vain: and to leave behind at starting a life ofdistinction and love: and to find, if he found anything, the oldexacting companionship which was known by rote beforehand. Certainlythe gems and therefore the florins were, in a sense, Baldassarre\u2019s: inthe narrow sense by which the right of possession is determined inordinary affairs; but in that large and more radically natural view bywhich the world belongs to youth and strength, they were rather his whocould extract the most pleasure out of them. That, he was conscious,was not the sentiment which the complicated play of human feelings hadengendered in society. The men around him would expect that he shouldimmediately apply those florins to his benefactor\u2019s rescue. But whatwas the sentiment of society?\u2014a mere tangle of anomalous traditions andopinions, which no wise man would take as a guide, except so far as hisown comfort was concerned. Not that he cared for the florins saveperhaps for Romola\u2019s sake: he would give up the florins readily enough.It was the joy that was due to him and was close to his lips, which hefelt he was not bound to thrust away from him and so travel on,thirsting. Any maxims that required a man to fling away the good thatwas needed to make existence sweet, were only the lining of humanselfishness turned outward: they were made by men who wanted others tosacrifice themselves for their sake. He would rather that Baldassarreshould not suffer: he liked no one to suffer; but could any philosophyprove to him that he was bound to care for another\u2019s suffering morethan for his own?

Suchterror of the unseen is so far above mere sensual cowardice that itwill annihilate that cowardice: it is the initial recognition of amoral law restraining desire, and checks the hard bold scrutiny ofimperfect thought into obligations which can never be proved to haveany sanctity in the absence of feeling. \u201cIt is good,\u201d sing the oldEumenides, in Aeschylus, \u201cthat fear should sit as the guardian of thesoul, forcing it into wisdom\u2014good that men should carry a threateningshadow in their hearts under the full sunshine; else, how should theylearn to revere the right?\u201d That guardianship may become needless; butonly when all outward law has become needless\u2014only when duty and lovehave united in one stream and made a common force."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"As Tito entered the outer cloister of San Marco, and inquired for FraLuca, there was no shadowy presentiment in his mind: he felt himselftoo cultured and sceptical for that: he had been nurtured in contemptfor the tales of priests whose impudent lives were a proverb, and inerudite familiarity with disputes concerning the Chief Good, which hadafter all, he considered, left it a matter of taste.
