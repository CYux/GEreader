But there were obvious facts that atonce threw discredit on the printed document. Was not the list ofsixteen examiners half made up of the prophet\u2019s bitterest enemies? Wasnot the notorious Dolfo Spini one of the new Eight prematurely elected,in order to load the dice against a man whose ruin had been determinedon by the party in power? It was but a murder with slow formalitiesthat was being transacted in the Old Palace. The Signoria had resolvedto drive a good bargain with the Pope and the Duke of Milan, byextinguishing the man who was as great a molestation to viciouscitizens and greedy foreign tyrants as to a corrupt clergy. The Fratehad been doomed beforehand, and the only question that was pretended toexist now was, whether the Republic, in return for a permission to laya tax on ecclesiastical property, should deliver him alive into thehands of the Pope, or whether the Pope should further concede to theRepublic what its dignity demanded\u2014the privilege of hanging and burningits own prophet on its own piazza."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Who, under such circumstances, would give full credit to this so-calledconfession?

It must be clearto all impartial men that if this examination represented the onlyevidence against the Frate, he would die, not for any crime, butbecause he had made himself inconvenient to the Pope, to the rapaciousItalian States that wanted to dismember their Tuscan neighbour, and tothose unworthy citizens who sought to gratify their private ambition inopposition to the common weal."),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"Not a shadow of political crime had been proved against him.

The Pope himself had not been able to raise a charge ofheresy against the Frate, except on the ground of disobedience to amandate, and disregard of the sentence of excommunication.

Hardly a word was dishonourable to him except what turned onhis prophetic annunciations.
