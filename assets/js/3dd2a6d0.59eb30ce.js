In the last threemonths, during which he had foreseen the discovery of the Mediceanconspirators as a probable event, he had had plenty of time to providehimself with resources. He had been strengthening his influence at Romeand at Milan, by being the medium of secret information and indirectmeasures against the Frate and the popular party; he had cultivatedmore assiduously than ever the regard of this party, by showing subtleevidence that his political convictions were entirely on their side;and all the while, instead of withdrawing his agency from theMediceans, he had sought to be more actively employed and exclusivelytrusted by them. It was easy to him to keep up this triple game. Theprinciple of duplicity admitted by the Mediceans on their own behalfdeprived them of any standard by which they could measure thetrustworthiness of a colleague who had not, like themselves, hereditaryinterests, alliances, and prejudices, which were intensely Medicean. Intheir minds, to deceive the opposite party was fair stratagem; todeceive their own party was a baseness to which they felt notemptation; and, in using Tito\u2019s facile ability, they were not keenlyawake to the fact that the absence of traditional attachments whichmade him a convenient agent was also the absence of what amongthemselves was the chief guarantee of mutual honour. Again, the Romanand Milanese friends of the aristocratic party, or Arrabbiati, who werethe bitterest enemies of Savonarola, carried on a system of underhandcorrespondence and espionage, in which the deepest hypocrisy was thebest service, and demanded the heaviest pay; so that to suspect anagent because he played a part strongly would have been an absurd wantof logic. On the other hand, the Piagnoni of the popular party, who hadthe directness that belongs to energetic conviction, were the moreinclined to credit Tito with sincerity in his political adhesion tothem, because he affected no religious sympathies."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"By virtue of these conditions, the last three months had been a time offlattering success to Tito. The result he most cared for was thesecuring of a future position for himself at Rome or at Milan; for hehad a growing determination, when the favourable moment should come, toquit Florence for one of those great capitals where life was easier,and the rewards of talent and learning were more splendid. At present,the scale dipped in favour of Milan; and if within the year he couldrender certain services to Duke Ludovico Sforza, he had the prospect ofa place at the Milanese court which outweighed the advantages of Rome."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The revelation of the Medicean conspiracy, then, had been a subject offorethought to Tito; but he had not been able to foresee the mode inwhich it would be brought about. The arrest of Lamberto dell\u2019 Antellawith a tell-tale letter on his person, and a bitter rancour against theMedici in his heart, was an incalculable event. It was not possible, inspite of the careful pretexts with which his agency had been guarded,that Tito should escape implication: he had never expected this in caseof any wide discovery concerning the Medicean plots. But his quick mindhad soon traced out the course that would secure his own safety withthe fewest unpleasant concomitants. It is agreeable to keep a wholeskin; but the skin still remains an organ sensitive to the atmosphere."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"His reckoning had not deceived him. That night, before he returnedhome, he had secured the three results for which he most cared: he wasto be freed from all proceedings against him on account of complicitywith the Mediceans; he was to retain his secretaryship for anotheryear, unless he previously resigned it; and, lastly, the price by whichhe had obtained these guarantees was to be kept as a State secret. Theprice would have been thought heavy by most men; and Tito himself wouldrather not have paid it."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"He had applied himself first to win the mind of Francesco Valori, whowas not only one of the Ten under whom he immediately held hissecretaryship, but one of the special council appointed to investigatethe evidence of the plot. Francesco Valori, as we have seen, was thehead of the Piagnoni, a man with certain fine qualities that were notincompatible with violent partisanship, with an arrogant temper thatalienated his friends, nor with bitter personal animosities\u2014one of thebitterest being directed against Bernardo del Nero. To him, in a briefprivate interview, after obtaining a pledge of secrecy, Tito avowed hisown agency for the Mediceans\u2014an agency induced by motives about whichhe was very frank, declaring at the same time that he had alwaysbelieved their efforts futile, and that he sincerely preferred themaintenance of the popular government; affected to confide to Valori,as a secret, his own personal dislike for Bernardo del Nero; and, afterthis preparation, came to the important statement that there wasanother Medicean plot, of which, if he obtained certain conditions fromthe government, he could, by a journey to Siena and into Romagna, wherePiero de\u2019 Medici was again trying to gather forces, obtain documentaryevidence to lay before the council. To this end it was essential thathis character as a Medicean agent should be unshaken for all Mediceans,and hence the fact that he had been a source of information to theauthorities must be wrapped in profound secrecy. Still, some odour ofthe facts might escape in spite of precaution, and before Tito couldincur the unpleasant consequences of acting against his friends, hemust be assured of immunity from any prosecution as a Medicean, andfrom deprivation of office for a year to come."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"These propositions did not sound in the ear of Francesco Valoriprecisely as they sound to us. Valori\u2019s mind was not intensely bent onthe estimation of Tito\u2019s conduct; and it ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"was")," intensely bent onprocuring an extreme sentence against the five prisoners. There weresure to be immense efforts to save them; and it was to be wished (onpublic grounds) that the evidence against them should be of thestrongest, so as to alarm all well-affected men at the dangers ofclemency. The character of legal proceedings at that time implied thatevidence was one of those desirable things which could only be come atby foul means. To catch a few people and torture them into confessingeverybody\u2019s guilt was one step towards justice; and it was not alwayseasy to see the next, unless a traitor turned up. Lamberto dell\u2019Antella had been tortured in aid of his previous willingness to tellmore than he knew; nevertheless, additional and stronger facts weredesirable, especially against Bernardo del Nero, who, so far asappeared hitherto, had simply refrained from betraying the late plotafter having tried in vain to discourage it; for the welfare ofFlorence demanded that the guilt of Bernardo del Nero should be put inthe strongest light. So Francesco Valori zealously believed; andperhaps he was not himself aware that the strength of his zeal wasdetermined by his hatred. He decided that Tito\u2019s proposition ought tobe accepted, laid it before his colleagues without disclosing Tito\u2019sname, and won them over to his opinion. Late in the day, Tito wasadmitted to an audience of the Special Council, and produced a deepsensation among them by revealing another plot for insuring the masteryof Florence to Piero de\u2019 Medici, which was to have been carried intoexecution in the middle of this very month of August. Documentaryevidence on this subject would do more than anything else to make theright course clear. He received a commission to start for Siena bybreak of day; and, besides this, he carried away with him from thecouncil-chamber a written guarantee of his immunity and of hisretention of office."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Among the twenty Florentines who bent their grave eyes on Tito, as hestood gracefully before them, speaking of startling things with easyperiphrasis, and with that apparently unaffected admission of beingactuated by motives short of the highest, which is often the intensestaffectation, there were several whose minds were not too entirelypreoccupied to pass a new judgment on him in these new circumstances;they silently concluded that this ingenious and serviceable Greek wasin future rather to be used for public needs than for private intimacy.Unprincipled men were useful, enabling those who had more scruples tokeep their hands tolerably clean in a world where there was much dirtywork to be done. Indeed, it was not clear to respectable Florentinebrains, unless they held the Frate\u2019s extravagant belief in a possiblepurity and loftiness to be striven for on this earth, how life was tobe carried on in any department without human instruments whom it wouldnot be unbecoming to kick or to spit upon in the act of handing themtheir wages. Some of these very men who passed a tacit judgment on Titowere shortly to be engaged in a memorable transaction that could by nomeans have been carried through without the use of an unscrupulousnessas decided as his; but, as their own bright poet Pulci had said forthem, it is one thing to love the fruits of treachery, and anotherthing to love traitors\u2014"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"\u201cIl tradimento a molti piace assai,Ma il traditore a gnun non piacque mal.\u201d"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The same society has had a gibbet for the murderer and a gibbet for themartyr, an execrating hiss for a dastardly act, and as loud a hiss formany a word of generous truthfulness or just insight: a mixed conditionof things which is the sign, not of hopeless confusion, but ofstruggling order."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"For Tito himself, he was not unaware that he had sunk a little in theestimate of the men who had accepted his services. He had that degreeof self-contemplation which necessarily accompanies the habit of actingon well-considered reasons, of whatever quality; and if he could havechosen, he would have declined to see himself disapproved by men of theworld. He had never meant to be disapproved; he had meant always toconduct himself so ably that if he acted in opposition to the standardof other men they should not be aware of it; and the barrier betweenhimself and Romola had been raised by the impossibility of suchconcealment with her. He shrank from condemnatory judgments as from aclimate to which he could not adapt himself. But things were not soplastic in the hands of cleverness as could be wished, and events hadturned out inconveniently. He had really no rancour against MesserBernardo del Nero: he had a personal liking for Lorenzo Tornabuoni andGiannozzo Pucci. He had served them very ably, and in such a way thatif their party had been winners he would have merited high reward; butwas he to relinquish all the agreeable fruits of life because theirparty had failed? His proffer of a little additional proof against themwould probably have no influence on their fate; in fact, he feltconvinced they would escape any extreme consequences; but if he had notgiven it, his own fortunes, which made a promising fabric, would havebeen utterly ruined. And what motive could any man really have, excepthis own interest? Florentines whose passions were engaged in theirpetty and precarious political schemes might have no self-interestseparable from family pride and tenacity in old hatreds andattachments; a modern simpleton who swallowed whole one of the oldsystems of philosophy, and took the indigestion it occasioned for thesigns of a divine afflux or the voice of an inward monitor, might seehis interest in a form of self-conceit which he called self-rewardingvirtue; fanatics who believed in the coming Scourge and Renovationmight see their own interest in a future palm-branch and white robe:but no man of clear intellect allowed his course to be determined bysuch puerile impulses or questionable inward fumes. Did not Pontanus,poet and philosopher of unrivalled Latinity, make the finest possibleoration at Naples to welcome the French king, who had come to dethronethe learned orator\u2019s royal friend and patron? and still Pontanus heldup his head and prospered. Men did not really care about these things,except when their personal spleen was touched. It was weakness onlythat was despised; power of any sort carried its immunity; and no man,unless by very rare good fortune, could mount high in the world withoutincurring a few unpleasant necessities which laid him open to enmity,and perhaps to a little hissing, when enmity wanted a pretext."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"It was a faint prognostic of that hissing, gathered by Tito fromcertain indications when he was before the council, which gave hispresent conduct the character of an epoch to him, and made him dwell onit with argumentative vindication. It was not that he was taking adeeper step in wrong-doing, for it was not possible that he should feelany tie to the Mediceans to be stronger than the tie to his father; buthis conduct to his father had been hidden by successful lying: hispresent act did not admit of total concealment\u2014in its very nature itwas a revelation. And Tito winced under his new liability to disesteem."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Well! a little patience, and in another year, or perhaps in half ayear, he might turn his back on these hard, eager Florentines, withtheir futile quarrels and sinking fortunes.

But as Tito galloped with a loose rein towards Siena, hesaw a future before him in which he would no longer be haunted by thosemistakes. He had much money safe out of Florence already; he was in thefresh ripeness of eight-and-twenty; he was conscious of well-triedskill.
