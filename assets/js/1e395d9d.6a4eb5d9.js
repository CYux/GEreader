She had beforehand feltan inward shrinking from a new guide who was a total stranger to her:but to have resisted Savonarola\u2019s advice would have been to assume anattitude of independence at a moment when all her strength must bedrawn from the renunciation of independence. And the whole bent of hermind now was towards doing what was painful rather than what was easy.She bowed reverently to Fra Salvestro before looking directly at him;but when she raised her head and saw him fully, her reluctance became apalpitating doubt. There are men whose presence infuses trust andreverence; there are others to whom we have need to carry our trust andreverence ready-made; and that difference flashed on Romola as sheceased to have Savonarola before her, and saw in his stead FraSalvestro Maruffi. It was not that there was anything manifestlyrepulsive in Fra Salvestro\u2019s face and manner, any air of hypocrisy, anytinge of coarseness; his face was handsomer than Fra Girolamo\u2019s, hisperson a little taller. He was the long-accepted confessor of manyamong the chief personages in Florence, and had therefore had largeexperience as a spiritual director. But his face had the vacillatingexpression of a mind unable to concentrate itself strongly in thechannel of one great emotion or belief\u2014an expression which is fatal toinfluence over an ardent nature like Romola\u2019s. Such an expression isnot the stamp of insincerity; it is the stamp simply of a shallow soul,which will often be found sincerely striving to fill a high vocation,sincerely composing its countenance to the utterance of sublimeformulas, but finding the muscles twitch or relax in spite of belief,as prose insists on coming instead of poetry to the man who has not thedivine frenzy. Fra Salvestro had a peculiar liability to visions,dependent apparently on a constitution given to somnambulism.Savonarola believed in the supernatural character of these visions,while Fra Salvestro himself had originally resisted such aninterpretation of them, and had even rebuked Savonarola for hisprophetic preaching: another proof, if one were wanted, that therelative greatness of men is not to be gauged by their tendency todisbelieve the superstitions of their age. For of these two there canbe no question which was the great man and which the small."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The difference between them was measured very accurately by the changein Romola\u2019s feeling as Fra Salvestro began to address her in words ofexhortation and encouragement. After her first angry resistance ofSavonarola had passed away, she had lost all remembrance of the olddread lest any influence should drag her within the circle offanaticism and sour monkish piety. But now again, the chill breath ofthat dread stole over her. It could have no decisive effect against theimpetus her mind had just received; it was only like the closing of thegrey clouds over the sunrise, which made her returning path monotonousand sombre."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"And perhaps of all sombre paths that on which we go back after treadingit with a strong resolution is the one that most severely tests thefervour of renunciation.
