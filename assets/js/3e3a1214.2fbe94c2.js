But he searched in vain; and he was leavingthe church, weary of a scene which had no variety, when, just againstthe doorway, he caught sight of Tessa, only two yards off him. She waskneeling with her back against the wall, behind a group ofpeasant-women, who were standing and looking for a spot nearer to thesacred image. Her head hung a little aside with a look of weariness,and her blue eyes were directed rather absently towards an altar-piecewhere the Archangel Michael stood in his armour, with young face andfloating hair, amongst bearded and tonsured saints. Her right-hand,holding a bunch of cocoons, fell by her side listlessly, and her roundcheek was paled, either by the light or by the weariness that wasexpressed in her attitude: her lips were pressed poutingly together,and every now and then her eyelids half fell: she was a large image ofa sweet sleepy child. Tito felt an irresistible desire to go up to herand get her pretty trusting looks and prattle: this creature who waswithout moral judgment that could condemn him, whose little lovingignorant soul made a world apart, where he might feel in freedom fromsuspicions and exacting demands, had a new attraction for him now. Sheseemed a refuge from the threatened isolation that would come withdisgrace.
