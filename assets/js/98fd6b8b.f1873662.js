It was only usual forhim to pay her such an official attention when it was obviouslydemanded from him. Tito and Romola never jarred, never remonstratedwith each other. They were too hopelessly alienated in their inner lifeever to have that contest which is an effort towards agreement. Theytalked of all affairs, public and private, with careful adherence to anadopted course. If Tito wanted a supper prepared in the old library,now pleasantly furnished as a banqueting-room, Romola assented, and sawthat everything needful was done: and Tito, on his side, left herentirely uncontrolled in her daily habits, accepting the help sheoffered him in transcribing or making digests, and in return meetingher conjectured want of supplies for her charities.

He cared for noexplanation between them; he felt any thorough explanation impossible:he would have cared to have Romola fond again, and to her, fondness wasimpossible. She could be submissive and gentle, she could repress anysign of repulsion; but tenderness was not to be feigned.

He had already during the day had one momentous interview withDolfo Spini, and the business he had spoken of to Romola as yet to bedone was a second interview with that personage, a sequence of thevisit he had paid at San Marco. Tito, by a long-preconcerted plan, hadbeen the bearer of letters to Savonarola\u2014carefully-forged letters; oneof them, by a stratagem, bearing the very signature and seal of theCardinal of Naples, who of all the Sacred College had most exerted hisinfluence at Rome in favour of the Frate. The purport of the letterswas to state that the Cardinal was on his progress from Pisa, and,unwilling for strong reasons to enter Florence, yet desirous of takingcounsel with Savonarola at this difficult juncture, intended to pausethis very day at San Casciano, about ten miles from the city, whence hewould ride out the next morning in the plain garb of a priest, and meetSavonarola, as if casually, five miles on the Florence road, two hoursafter sunrise. The plot, of which these forged letters were the initialstep, was that Dolfo Spini with a band of his Compagnacci was to beposted in ambush on the road, at a lonely spot about five miles fromthe gates; that he was to seize Savonarola with the Dominican brotherwho would accompany him according to rule, and deliver him over to asmall detachment of Milanese horse in readiness near San Casciano, bywhom he was to be carried into the Roman territory."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"There was a strong chance that the penetrating Frate would suspect atrap, and decline to incur the risk, which he had for some timeavoided, of going beyond the city walls.

On this ground the minimum of timehad been given him for decision, and the chance in favour of his actingon the letters was, that the eagerness with which his mind was set onthe combining of interests within and without the Church towards theprocuring of a General Council, and also the expectation of immediateservice from the Cardinal in the actual juncture of his contest withthe Pope, would triumph over his shrewdness and caution in the briefspace allowed for deliberation."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Tito had had an audience of Savonarola, having declined to put theletters into any hands but his, and with consummate art had admittedthat incidentally, and by inference, he was able so far to conjecturetheir purport as to believe they referred to a rendezvous outside thegates, in which case he urged that the Frate should seek an armed guardfrom the Signoria, and offered his services in carrying the requestwith the utmost privacy. Savonarola had replied briefly that this wasimpossible: an armed guard was incompatible with privacy.
