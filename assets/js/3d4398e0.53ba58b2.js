In a tiny gold loop ofthe circlet a sugar-plum had lodged\u2014a pink hailstone from the shower ofsweets: Tito had detected it first, and had said that it should alwaysremain there. At certain moments\u2014and this was one of them\u2014Romola wascarried, by a sudden wave of memory, back again into the time ofperfect trust, and felt again the presence of the husband whose lovemade the world as fresh and wonderful to her as to a little child thatsits in stillness among the sunny flowers: heard the gentle tones andsaw the soft eyes without any lie in them, and breathed again thatlarge freedom of the soul which comes from the faith that the being whois nearest to us is greater than ourselves.

She turned away her eyes from the white and gold to the darkbundle, and as her hands touched the serge, her tears began to bechecked. That coarse roughness recalled her fully to the present, fromwhich love and delight were gone. She unfastened the thick white cordand spread the bundle out on the table. It was the grey serge dress ofa sister belonging to the third order of Saint Francis, living in theworld but especially devoted to deeds of piety\u2014a personage whom theFlorentines were accustomed to call a Pinzochera. Romola was going toput on this dress as a disguise, and she determined to put it on atonce, so that, if she needed sleep before the morning, she might wakeup in perfect readiness to be gone. She put off her black garment, andas she thrust her soft white arms into the harsh sleeves of the sergemantle and felt the hard girdle of rope hurt her fingers as she tiedit, she courted those rude sensations: they were in keeping with hernew scorn of that thing called pleasure which made men base\u2014thatdexterous contrivance for selfish ease, that shrinking from enduranceand strain, when others were bowing beneath burdens too heavy for them,which now made one image with her husband. Then she gathered her longhair together, drew it away tight from her face, bound it in a greathard knot at the back of her head, and taking a square piece of blacksilk, tied it in the fashion of a kerchief close across her head andunder her chin; and over that she drew the cowl. She lifted the candleto the mirror. Surely her disguise would be complete to any one who hadnot lived very near to her. To herself she looked strangely like herbrother Dino: the full oval of the cheek had only to be wasted; theeyes, already sad, had only to become a little sunken.

Romola\u2019s mind had beenrushing with an impetuous current towards this act, for which she waspreparing: the act of quitting a husband who had disappointed all hertrust, the act of breaking an outward tie that no longer representedthe inward bond of love. But that force of outward symbols by which ouractive life is knit together so as to make an inexorable externalidentity for us, not to be shaken by our wavering consciousness, gave astrange effect to this simple movement towards taking off her ring\u2014amovement which was but a small sequence of her energetic resolution. Itbrought a vague but arresting sense that she was somehow violentlyrending her life in two: a presentiment that the strong impulse whichhad seemed to exclude doubt and make her path clear might after all beblindness, and that there was something in human bonds which mustprevent them from being broken with the breaking of illusions."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"If that beloved Tito who had placed the betrothal ring on her fingerwas not in any valid sense the same Tito whom she had ceased to love,why should she return to him the sign of their union, and not ratherretain it as a memorial?

Her inexperience prevented her from picturing distantdetails, and it helped her proud courage in shutting out any forebodingof danger and insult.
