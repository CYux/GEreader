Did the reason lie inherself? She might perhaps have thought so, if there had not been thefacts of the armour and the picture to suggest some external eventwhich was an entire mystery to her."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"But Tito no sooner believed that Romola was out of the house than helaid down his pen and looked up, in delightful security from seeinganything else than parchment and broken marble. He was rather disgustedwith himself that he had not been able to look up at Romola and behaveto her just as usual. He would have chosen, if he could, to be evenmore than usually kind; but he could not, on a sudden, master aninvoluntary shrinking from her, which, by a subtle relation, dependedon those very characteristics in him that made him desire not to failin his marks of affection. He was about to take a step which he knewwould arouse her deep indignation; he would have to encounter much thatwas unpleasant before he could win her forgiveness. And Tito couldnever find it easy to face displeasure and anger; his nature was one ofthose most remote from defiance or impudence, and all his inclinationsleaned towards preserving Romola\u2019s tenderness. He was not tormented bysentimental scruples which, as he had demonstrated to himself by a veryrapid course of argument, had no relation to solid utility; but hisfreedom from scruples did not release him from the dread of what wasdisagreeable. Unscrupulousness gets rid of much, but not of toothache,or wounded vanity, or the sense of loneliness, against which, as theworld at present stands, there is no security but a thoroughly healthyjaw, and a just, loving soul. And Tito was feeling intensely at thismoment that no devices could save him from pain in the impendingcollision with Romola; no persuasive blandness could cushion himagainst the shock towards which he was being driven like a timid animalurged to a desperate leap by the terror of the tooth and the claw thatare close behind it."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The secret feeling he had previously had that the tenacious adherenceto Bardo\u2019s wishes about the library had become under existingdifficulties a piece of sentimental folly, which deprived himself andRomola of substantial advantages, might perhaps never have wroughtitself into action but for the events of the past week, which hadbrought at once the pressure of a new motive and the outlet of a rareopportunity. Nay, it was not till his dread had been aggravated by thesight of Baldassarre looking more like his sane self, not until he hadbegun to feel that he might be compelled to flee from Florence, that hehad brought himself to resolve on using his legal right to sell thelibrary before the great opportunity offered by French and Milanesebidders slipped through his fingers. For if he had to leave Florence hedid not want to leave it as a destitute wanderer. He had been used toan agreeable existence, and he wished to carry with him all the meansat hand for retaining the same agreeable conditions. He wished amongother things to carry Romola with him, and ",(0,o.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"not"),", if possible, to carryany infamy. Success had given him a growing appetite for all thepleasures that depend on an advantageous social position, and at nomoment could it look like a temptation to him, but only like a hideousalternative, to decamp under dishonour, even with a bag of diamonds,and incur the life of an adventurer. It was not possible for him tomake himself independent even of those Florentines who only greeted himwith regard; still less was it possible for him to make himselfindependent of Romola. She was the wife of his first love\u2014he loved herstill; she belonged to that furniture of life which he shrank fromparting with. He winced under her judgment, he felt uncertain how farthe revulsion of her feeling towards him might go; and all that senseof power over a wife which makes a husband risk betrayals that a lovernever ventures on, would not suffice to counteract Tito\u2019s uneasiness.This was the leaden weight which had been too strong for his will, andkept him from raising his head to meet her eyes. Their pure lightbrought too near him the prospect of a coming struggle. But it was notto be helped; if they had to leave Florence, they must have money;indeed, Tito could not arrange life at all to his mind without aconsiderable sum of money.
