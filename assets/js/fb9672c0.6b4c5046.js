No: in such a case as this, if God hadchosen the Frate as his prophet to rebuke the High Priest who carriedthe mystic raiment unworthily, he would attest his choice by someunmistakable sign. As long as the belief in the Prophet carried nothreat of outward calamity, but rather the confident hope ofexceptional safety, no sign was needed: his preaching was a music towhich the people felt themselves marching along the way they wished togo; but now that belief meant an immediate blow to their commerce, theshaking of their position among the Italian States, and an interdict ontheir city, there inevitably came the question, \u201cWhat miracle showestthou?\u201d Slowly at first, then faster and faster, that fatal demand hadbeen swelling in Savonarola\u2019s ear, provoking a response, outwardly inthe declaration that at the fitting time the miracle would come;inwardly in the faith\u2014not unwavering, for what faith is so?\u2014that if theneed for miracle became urgent, the work he had before him was toogreat for the Divine power to leave it halting.
