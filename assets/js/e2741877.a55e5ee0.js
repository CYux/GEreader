Forhe had been rather afraid of Ser Ceccone. Tito\u2019s nature made himpeculiarly alive to circumstances that might be turned to hisdisadvantage; his memory was much haunted by such possibilities,stimulating him to contrivances by which he might ward them off. And itwas not likely that he should forget that October morning more than ayear ago, when Romola had appeared suddenly before him at the door ofNello\u2019s shop, and had compelled him to declare his certainty that FraGirolamo was not going outside the gates. The fact that Ser Ceccone hadbeen a witness of that scene, together with Tito\u2019s perception that forsome reason or other he was an object of dislike to the notary, hadreceived a new importance from the recent turn of events. For afterhaving been implicated in the Medicean plots, and having found itadvisable in consequence to retire into the country for some time, SerCeccone had of late, since his reappearance in the city, attachedhimself to the Arrabbiati, and cultivated the patronage of Dolfo Spini.Now that captain of the Compagnacci was much given, when in the companyof intimates, to confidential narrative about his own doings, and ifSer Ceccone\u2019s powers of combination were sharpened by enmity, he mightgather some knowledge which he could use against Tito with veryunpleasant results."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"It would be pitiable to be balked in well-conducted schemes by aninsignificant notary; to be lamed by the sting of an insect whom he hadoffended unawares. \u201cBut,\u201d Tito said to himself, \u201cthe man\u2019s dislike tome can be nothing deeper than the ill-humour of a dinnerless dog; Ishall conquer it if I can make him prosperous.\u201d And he had been veryglad of an opportunity which had presented itself of providing thenotary with a temporary post as an extra ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"cancelliere")," or registeringsecretary under the Ten, believing that with this sop and theexpectation of more, the waspish cur must be quite cured of thedisposition to bite him."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"But perfect scheming demands omniscience, and the notary\u2019s envy hadbeen stimulated into hatred by causes of which Tito knew nothing. Thatevening when Tito, returning from his critical audience with theSpecial Council, had brushed by Ser Ceccone on the stairs, the notary,who had only just returned from Pistoja, and learned the arrest of theconspirators, was bound on an errand which bore a humble resemblance toTito\u2019s. He also, without giving up a show of popular zeal, had beenputting in the Medicean lottery. He also had been privy to theunexecuted plot, and was willing to tell what he knew, but knew muchless to tell. He also would have been willing to go on treacherouserrands, but a more eligible agent had forestalled him. Hispropositions were received coldly; the council, he was told, wasalready in possession of the needed information, and since he had beenthus busy in sedition, it would be well for him to retire out of theway of mischief, otherwise the government might be obliged to take noteof him. Ser Ceccone wanted no evidence to make him attribute hisfailure to Tito, and his spite was the more bitter because the natureof the case compelled him to hold his peace about it. Nor was this thewhole of his grudge against the flourishing Melema. On issuing from hishiding-place, and attaching himself to the Arrabbiati, he had earnedsome pay as one of the spies who reported information on Florentineaffairs to the Milanese court; but his pay had been small,notwithstanding his pains to write full letters, and he had lately beenapprised that his news was seldom more than a late and imperfectedition of what was known already. Now Ser Ceccone had no positiveknowledge that Tito had an underhand connection with the Arrabbiati andthe Court of Milan, but he had a suspicion of which he chewed the cudwith as strong a sense of flavour as if it had been a certainty."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"This fine-grown vigorous hatred could swallow the feeble opiate ofTito\u2019s favours, and be as lively as ever after it. Why should SerCeccone like Melema any the better for doing him favours? Doubtless thesuave secretary had his own ends to serve; and what right had he to thesuperior position which made it possible for him to show favour? Butsince he had tuned his voice to flattery, Ser Ceccone would pitch hisin the same key, and it remained to be seen who would win at the gameof outwitting."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"To have a mind well oiled with that sort of argument which prevents anyclaim from grasping it, seems eminently convenient sometimes: only theoil becomes objectionable when we find it anointing other minds onwhich we want to establish a hold."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Tito, however, not being quite omniscient, felt now no more than apassing twinge of uneasiness at the suggestion of Ser Ceccone\u2019s powerto hurt him. It was only for a little while that he cared greatly aboutkeeping clear of suspicions and hostility. He was now playing his finalgame in Florence, and the skill he was conscious of applying gave him apleasure in it even apart from the expected winnings. The errand onwhich he was sent to San Marco was a stroke in which he felt so muchconfidence that he had already given notice to the Ten of his desire toresign his office at an indefinite period within the next month or two,and had obtained permission to make that resignation suddenly, if hisaffairs needed it, with the understanding that Niccol\xf2 Macchiavelli wasto be his provisional substitute, if not his successor. He was actingon hypothetic grounds, but this was the sort of action that had thekeenest interest for his diplomatic mind. From a combination of generalknowledge concerning Savonarola\u2019s purposes with diligently observeddetails he had framed a conjecture which he was about to verify by thisvisit to San Marco. If he proved to be right, his game would be won,and he might soon turn his back on Florence. He looked eagerly towardsthat consummation, for many circumstances besides his own weariness ofthe place told him that it was time for him to be gone."))}u.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
