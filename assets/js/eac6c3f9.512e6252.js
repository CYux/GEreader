Their seriousview of things filled the air like an odour; nothing seemed to haveexactly the same flavour as it used to have; and there was the dearchild Romola, in her youth and beauty, leading a life that wasuncomfortably suggestive of rigorous demands on woman. A widow atfifty-five whose satisfaction has been largely drawn from what shethinks of her own person, and what she believes others think of it,requires a great fund of imagination to keep her spirits buoyant. AndMonna Brigida had begun to have frequent struggles at her toilet. Ifher soul would prosper better without them, was it really worth whileto put on the rouge and the braids? But when she lifted up thehand-mirror and saw a sallow face with baggy cheeks, and crows\u2019-feetthat were not to be dissimulated by any simpering of the lips\u2014when sheparted her grey hair, and let it lie in simple Piagnone fashion roundher face, her courage failed. Monna Berta would certainly burst outlaughing at her, and call her an old hag, and as Monna Berta was reallyonly fifty-two, she had a superiority which would make the observationcutting. Every woman who was not a Piagnone would give a shrug at thesight of her, and the men would accost her as if she were theirgrandmother. Whereas, at fifty-five a woman was not so very old\u2014sheonly required making up a little. So the rouge and the braids and theembroidered berretta went on again, and Monna Brigida was satisfiedwith the accustomed effect; as for her neck, if she covered it up,people might suppose it was too old to show, and, on the contrary, withthe necklaces round it, it looked better than Monna Berta\u2019s. This veryday, when she was preparing for the Piagnone Carnival, such a strugglehad occurred, and the conflicting fears and longings which caused thestruggle, caused her to turn back and seek refuge in the druggist\u2019sshop rather than encounter the collectors of the Anathema when Romolawas not by her side. But Monna Brigida was not quite rapid enough inher retreat. She had been descried, even before she turned away, by thewhite-robed boys in the rear of those who wheeled round towards Tessa,and the willingness with which Tessa was given up was, perhaps,slightly due to the fact that part of the troop had already accosted apersonage carrying more markedly upon her the dangerous weight of theAnathema. It happened that several of this troop were at the youngestage taken into peculiar training; and a small fellow of ten, his olivewreath resting above cherubic cheeks and wide brown eyes, hisimagination really possessed with a hovering awe at existence assomething in which great consequences impended on being good or bad,his longings nevertheless running in the direction of mastery andmischief, was the first to reach Monna Brigida and place himself acrossher path. She felt angry, and looked for an open door, but there wasnot one at hand, and by attempting to escape now, she would only makethings worse.
