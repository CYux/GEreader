If everything else is doubtful, this suffering that I can helpis certain; if the glory of the cross is an illusion, the sorrow isonly the truer.

Her work in thisgreen valley was done, and the emotions that were disengaged from thepeople immediately around her rushed back into the old deep channels ofuse and affection. That rare possibility of self-contemplation whichcomes in any complete severance from our wonted life made her judgeherself as she had never done before: the compunction which isinseparable from a sympathetic nature keenly alive to the possibleexperience of others, began to stir in her with growing force. Shequestioned the justness of her own conclusions, of her own deeds: shehad been rash, arrogant, always dissatisfied that others were not goodenough, while she herself had not been true to what her soul had oncerecognised as the best. She began to condemn her flight: after all, ithad been cowardly self-care; the grounds on which Savonarola had oncetaken her back were truer, deeper than the grounds she had had for hersecond flight.

What if the life of Florence was a web ofinconsistencies? Was she, then, something higher, that she should shakethe dust from off her feet, and say, \u201cThis world is not good enough forme\u201d?
