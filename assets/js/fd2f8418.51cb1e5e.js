It was not a long walk, but,for Tito, it was stretched out like the minutes of our morning dreams:the short spaces of street and piazza held memories, and previsions,and torturing fears, that might have made the history of months. Hefelt as if a serpent had begun to coil round his limbs. Baldassarreliving, and in Florence, was a living revenge, which would no more restthan a winding serpent would rest until it had crushed its prey. It wasnot in the nature of that man to let an injury pass unavenged: his loveand his hatred were of that passionate fervour which subjugates all therest of the being, and makes a man sacrifice himself to his passion asif it were a deity to be worshipped with self-destruction. Baldassarrehad relaxed his hold, and had disappeared. Tito knew well how tointerpret that: it meant that the vengeance was to be studied that itmight be sure.

The chanceswere infinite against Baldassarre\u2019s having met again with any one ofthat crew, and Tito thought with bitterness that a timely, well-devisedfalsehood might have saved him from any fatal consequences.

Enough truth, atleast, to bear him out in his denial of any declaration Baldassarremight make about him?

Baldassarre belonged to a race to whom the thrust of the daggerseems almost as natural an impulse as the outleap of the tiger\u2019stalons. Tito shrank with shuddering dread from disgrace; but he hadalso that physical dread which is inseparable from a softpleasure-loving nature, and which prevents a man from meeting woundsand death as a welcome relief from disgrace.

He hadno sense that there was strength and safety in truth; the only strengthhe trusted to lay in his ingenuity and his dissimulation. Now that thefirst shock, which had called up the traitorous signs of fear, was wellpast, he hoped to be prepared for all emergencies by cool deceit\u2014anddefensive armour."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"It was a characteristic fact in Tito\u2019s experience at this crisis, thatno direct measures for ridding himself of Baldassarre ever occurred tohim. All other possibilities passed through his mind, even to his ownflight from Florence; but he never thought of any scheme for removinghis enemy. His dread generated no active malignity, and he would stillhave been glad not to give pain to any mortal. He had simply chosen tomake life easy to himself\u2014to carry his human lot, if possible, in sucha way that it should pinch him nowhere; and the choice had, at varioustimes, landed him in unexpected positions. The question now was, notwhether he should divide the common pressure of destiny with hissuffering fellow-men; it was whether all the resources of lying wouldsave him from being crushed by the consequences of that habitualchoice."))}c.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
