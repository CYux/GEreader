But it went on, and drewRomola so irresistibly, seeming the more piteous to her for the senseof peace which had preceded it, that she jumped on to the beach andwalked many paces before she knew what direction she would take. Thecry, she thought, came from some rough garden growth many yards on herright-hand, where she saw a half-ruined hovel. She climbed over a lowbroken stone fence, and made her way across patches of weedy greencrops and ripe but neglected corn. The cry grew plainer, and convincedthat she was right she hastened towards the hovel; but even in thathurried walk she felt an oppressive change in the air as she left thesea behind. Was there some taint lurking amongst the green luxuriancethat had seemed such an inviting shelter from the heat of the comingday? She could see the opening into the hovel now, and the cry wasdarting through her like a pain.

Romola\u2019s experience in the haunts ofdeath and disease made thought and action prompt: she lifted the littleliving child, and in trying to soothe it on her bosom, still sent tolook at the bodies and see if they were really dead. The stronglymarked type of race in their features, and their peculiar garb, madeher conjecture that they were Spanish or Portuguese Jews, who hadperhaps been put ashore and abandoned there by rapacious sailors, towhom their property remained as a prey.
