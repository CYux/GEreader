Andthe debate had been so much like fierce quarrel that the noise from thecouncil-chamber had reached the crowd outside. Only within the lasthour had the question been decided: the Signoria had remained divided,four of them standing out resolutely for the Appeal in spite of thestrong argument that if they did not give way their houses should besacked, until Francesco Valori, in brief and furious speech, made thedetermination of his party more ominously distinct by declaring that ifthe Signoria would not defend the liberties of the Florentine people byexecuting those five perfidious citizens, there would not be wantingothers who would take that cause in hand to the peril of all whoopposed it.
