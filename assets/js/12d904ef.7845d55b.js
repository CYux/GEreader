Stillwe have our limits beyond which we call dissimulation treachery. But itis said of the Greeks that their honesty begins at what is the hangingpoint with us, and that since the old Furies went to sleep, yourChristian Greek is of so easy a conscience that he would make astepping-stone of his father\u2019s corpse.\u201d"),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"The flush on the stranger\u2019s face indicated what seemed so natural amovement of resentment, that the good-natured Nello hastened to atonefor his want of reticence."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"\u201cBe not offended, ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"bel giovane"),"; I am but repeating what I hear in myshop; as you may perceive, my eloquence is simply the cream which Iskim off my clients\u2019 talk.

And for that same scholarlyobjection to the Greeks,\u201d added Nello, in a more mocking tone, and witha significant grimace, \u201cthe fact is, you are heretics, Messer; jealousyhas nothing to do with it: if you would just change your opinion aboutleaven, and alter your Doxology a little, our Italian scholars wouldthink it a thousand years till they could give up their chairs to you.Yes, yes; it is chiefly religious scruple, and partly also theauthority of a great classic,\u2014Juvenal, is it not?

I have a fineCleopatra cut in sardonyx, and one or two other intaglios and cameos,both curious and beautiful, worthy of being added to the cabinet of aprince. Happily, I had taken the precaution of fastening them withinthe lining of my doublet before I set out on my voyage.

What you want is a man ofwealth, and influence, and scholarly tastes\u2014not one of your learnedporcupines, bristling all over with critical tests, but one whose Greekand Latin are of a comfortable laxity.
