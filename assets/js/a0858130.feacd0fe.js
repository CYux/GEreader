It was true that the kindness was manifested towards apretty trusting thing whom it was impossible to be near without feelinginclined to caress and pet her; but it was not less true that Tito hadmovements of kindness towards her apart from any contemplated gain tohimself. Otherwise, charming as her prettiness and prattle were in alazy moment, he might have preferred to be free from her; for he wasnot in love with Tessa\u2014he was in love for the first time in his lifewith an entirely different woman, whom he was not simply inclined toshower caresses on, but whose presence possessed him so that the simplesweep of her long tresses across his cheek seemed to vibrate throughthe hours. All the young ideal passion he had in him had been stirredby Romola, and his fibre was too fine, his intellect too bright, forhim to be tempted into the habits of a gross pleasure-seeker. But hehad spun a web about himself and Tessa, which he felt incapable ofbreaking: in the first moments after the mimic marriage he had beenprompted to leave her under an illusion by a distinct calculation ofhis own possible need, but since that critical moment it seemed to himthat the web had gone on spinning itself in spite of him, like a growthover which he had no power. The elements of kindness andself-indulgence are hard to distinguish in a soft nature like Tito\u2019s;and the annoyance he had felt under Tessa\u2019s pursuit of him on the dayof his betrothal, the thorough intention of revealing the truth to herwith which he set out to fulfil his promise of seeing her again, were asufficiently strong argument to him that in ultimately leaving Tessaunder her illusion and providing a home for her, he had been overcomeby his own kindness. And in these days of his first devotion to Romolahe needed a self-justifying argument. He had learned to be glad thatshe was deceived about some things. But every strong feeling makes toitself a conscience of its own\u2014has its own piety; just as much as thefeeling of the son towards the mother, which will sometimes surviveamid the worst fumes of depravation; and Tito could not yet be easy incommitting a secret offence against his wedded love."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"But he was all the more careful in taking precautions to preserve thesecrecy of the offence. Monna Lisa, who, like many of her class, neverleft her habitation except to go to one or two particular shops, and toconfession once a year, knew nothing of his real name and whereabout:she only know that he paid her so as to make her very comfortable, andminded little about the rest, save that she got fond of Tessa, andfound pleasure in the cares for which she was paid. There was somemystery behind, clearly, since Tessa was a contadina, and Messer Naldowas a signor; but, for aught Monna Lisa knew, he might be a realhusband. For Tito had thoroughly frightened Tessa into silence aboutthe circumstances of their marriage, by telling her that if she brokethat silence she would never see him again; and Monna Lisa\u2019s deafness,which made it impossible to say anything to her without somepremeditation, had saved Tessa from any incautious revelation to her,such as had run off her tongue in talking with Baldassarre. For a longwhile Tito\u2019s visits were so rare, that it seemed likely enough he tookjourneys between them. They were prompted chiefly by the desire to seethat all things were going on well with Tessa; and though he alwaysfound his visit pleasanter than the prospect of it\u2014always felt anew thecharm of that pretty ignorant lovingness and trust\u2014he had not yet anyreal need of it. But he was determined, if possible, to preserve thesimplicity on which the charm depended; to keep Tessa a genuinecontadina, and not place the small field-flower among conditions thatwould rob it of its grace. He would have been shocked to see her in thedress of any other rank than her own; the piquancy of her talk would beall gone, if things began to have new relations for her, if her worldbecame wider, her pleasures less childish; and the squirrel-likeenjoyment of nuts at discretion marked the standard of the luxuries hehad provided for her. By this means, Tito saved Tessa\u2019s charm frombeing sullied; and he also, by a convenient coincidence, saved himselffrom aggravating expenses that were already rather importunate to a manwhose money was all required for his avowed habits of life."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"This, in brief, had been the history of Tito\u2019s relation to Tessa up toa very recent date. It is true that once or twice before Bardo\u2019s death,the sense that there was Tessa up the hill, with whom it was possibleto pass an hour agreeably, had been an inducement to him to escape froma little weariness of the old man, when, for lack of any positiveengagement, he might otherwise have borne the weariness patiently andshared Romola\u2019s burden.

It was the day when he had first seenBaldassarre, and had bought the armour. Returning across the bridgethat night, with the coat of mail in his hands, he had felt anunconquerable shrinking from an immediate encounter with Romola. She,too, knew little of the actual world; she, too, trusted him; but he hadan uneasy consciousness that behind her frank eyes there was a naturethat could judge him, and that any ill-founded trust of hers sprang notfrom pretty brute-like incapacity, but from a nobleness which mightprove an alarming touchstone. He wanted a little ease, a little reposefrom self-control, after the agitation and exertions of the day; hewanted to be where he could adjust his mind to the morrow, withoutcaring how he behaved at the present moment. And there was a sweetadoring creature within reach whose presence was as safe andunconstraining as that of her own kids,\u2014who would believe any fable,and remain quite unimpressed by public opinion.

He could not wish Tessa in his wife\u2019s place, orrefrain from wishing that his wife should be thoroughly reconciled tohim; for it was Romola, and not Tessa, that belonged to the world whereall the larger desires of a man who had ambition and effectivefaculties must necessarily lie.
