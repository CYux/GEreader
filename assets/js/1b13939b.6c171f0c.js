So that the pleasures of the Carnival were of a checkered kind,and if a painter were called upon to represent them truly, he wouldhave to make a picture in which there would be so much grossness andbarbarity that it must be turned with its face to the wall, except whenit was taken down for the grave historical purpose of justifying areforming zeal which, in ignorance of the facts, might be unfairlycondemned for its narrowness. Still there was much of that moreinnocent picturesque merriment which is never wanting among a peoplewith quick animal spirits and sensitive organs: there was not the heavysottishness which belongs to the thicker northern blood, nor thestealthy fierceness which in the more southern regions of the peninsulamakes the brawl lead to the dagger-thrust."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"It was the high morning, but the merry spirits of the Carnival werestill inclined to lounge and recapitulate the last night\u2019s jests, whenTito Melema was walking at a brisk pace on the way to the Via de\u2019Bardi. Young Bernardo Dovizi, who now looks at us out of Raphael\u2019sportrait as the keen-eyed Cardinal da Bibbiena, was with him; and, asthey went, they held animated talk about some subject that hadevidently no relation to the sights and sounds through which they werepushing their way along the Por\u2019 Santa Maria. Nevertheless, as theydiscussed, smiled, and gesticulated, they both, from time to time, castquick glances around them, and at the turning towards the Lung\u2019 Arno,leading to the Ponte Rubaconte, Tito had become aware, in one of theserapid surveys, that there was some one not far off him by whom he verymuch desired not to be recognised at that moment. His time and thoughtswere thoroughly preoccupied, for he was looking forward to a uniqueoccasion in his life: he was preparing for his betrothal, which was totake place on the evening of this very day. The ceremony had beenresolved upon rather suddenly; for although preparations towards themarriage had been going forward for some time\u2014chiefly in theapplication of Tito\u2019s florins to the fitting up of rooms in Bardo\u2019sdwelling, which, the library excepted, had always been scantilyfurnished\u2014it had been intended to defer both the betrothal and themarriage until after Easter, when Tito\u2019s year of probation, insisted onby Bernardo del Nero, would have been complete. But when an expressproposition had come, that Tito should follow the Cardinal Giovanni toRome to help Bernardo Dovizi with his superior knowledge of Greek inarranging a library, and there was no possibility of declining what layso plainly on the road to advancement, he had become urgent in hisentreaties that the betrothal might take place before his departure:there would be the less delay before the marriage on his return, and itwould be less painful to part if he and Romola were outwardly as wellas inwardly pledged to each other\u2014if he had a claim which defied MesserBernardo or any one else to nullify it. For the betrothal, at whichrings were exchanged and mutual contracts were signed, made more thanhalf the legality of marriage, to be completed on a separate occasionby the nuptial benediction.

It was not a time when any recognition couldbe pleasant that was at all likely to detain him; still less arecognition by Tessa. And it was unmistakably Tessa whom he had caughtsight of moving along, with a timid and forlorn look, towards that veryturn of the Lung\u2019 Arno which he was just rounding. As he continued histalk with the young Dovizi, he had an uncomfortable undercurrent ofconsciousness which told him that Tessa had seen him and wouldcertainly follow him: there was no escaping her along this direct roadby the Arno, and over the Ponte Rubaconte. But she would not dare tospeak to him or approach him while he was not alone, and he wouldcontinue to keep Dovizi with him till they reached Bardo\u2019s door. Hequickened his pace, and took up new threads of talk; but all the whilethe sense that Tessa was behind him, though he had no physical evidenceof the fact, grew stronger and stronger; it was very irritating\u2014perhapsall the more so because a certain tenderness and pity for the poorlittle thing made the determination to escape without any visiblenotice of her, a not altogether agreeable resource.
