Nevertheless, Bernardo himself, though he was asfar as ever from any susceptibility to the personal fascination in Titowhich was felt by others, could not altogether resist that argument ofsuccess which is always powerful with men of the world. Tito was makinghis way rapidly in high quarters. He was especially growing in favourwith the young Cardinal Giovanni de\u2019 Medici, who had even spoken ofTito\u2019s forming part of his learned retinue on an approaching journey toRome; and the bright young Greek who had a tongue that was always readywithout ever being quarrelsome, was more and more wished for at gaysuppers in the Via Larga, and at Florentine games in which he had nopretension to excel, and could admire the incomparable skill of Pierode\u2019 Medici in the most graceful manner in the world. By an unfailingsequence, Tito\u2019s reputation as an agreeable companion in \u201cmagnificent\u201dsociety made his learning and talent appear more lustrous: and he wasreally accomplished enough to prevent an exaggerated estimate frombeing hazardous to him. Messer Bernardo had old prejudices andattachments which now began to argue down the newer and feeblerprejudice against the young Greek stranger who was rather too supple.To the old Florentine it was impossible to despise the recommendationof standing well with the best Florentine families, and since Titobegan to be thoroughly received into that circle whose views were theunquestioned standard of social value, it seemed irrational not toadmit that there was no longer any check to satisfaction in theprospect of such a son-in-law for Bardo, and such a husband for Romola.It was undeniable that Tito\u2019s coming had been the dawn of a new lifefor both father and daughter, and the first promise had even beensurpassed. The blind old scholar\u2014whose proud truthfulness would neverenter into that commerce of feigned and preposterous admiration which,varied by a corresponding measurelessness in vituperation, made thewoof of all learned intercourse\u2014had fallen into neglect even among hisfellow-citizens, and when he was alluded to at all, it had long beenusual to say that, though his blindness and the loss of his son werepitiable misfortunes, he was tiresome in contending for the value ofhis own labours; and that his discontent was a little inconsistent in aman who had been openly regardless of religious rites, and who in dayspast had refused offers made to him from various quarters, on theslight condition that he would take orders, without which it was noteasy for patrons to provide for every scholar. But since Tito\u2019s coming,there was no longer the same monotony in the thought that Bardo\u2019s namesuggested; the old man, it was understood, had left off his plaints,and the fair daughter was no longer to be shut up in dowerless pride,waiting for a ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"parentado"),". The winning manners and growing favour ofthe handsome Greek who was expected to enter into the double relationof son and husband helped to make the new interest a thoroughlyfriendly one, and it was no longer a rare occurrence when a visitorenlivened the quiet library. Elderly men came from that indefiniteprompting to renew former intercourse which arises when an oldacquaintance begins to be newly talked about; and young men whom Titohad asked leave to bring once, found it easy to go again when theyovertook him on his way to the Via de\u2019 Bardi, and, resting their handson his shoulder, fell into easy chat with him. For it was pleasant tolook at Romola\u2019s beauty; to see her, like old Firenzuola\u2019s type ofwomanly majesty, \u201csitting with a certain grandeur, speaking withgravity, smiling with modesty, and casting around, as it were, an odourof queenliness;\u201d","[1]"," and she seemed to unfold like a strong white lilyunder this genial breath of admiration and homage; it was all one toher with her new bright life in Tito\u2019s love."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"[1]"," \u201cQuando una donna \xe8 grande, ben formata, porta ben sua persona,siede con una certa grandezza, parla con gravit\xe0, ride con modestia, efinalmente getta quasi un odor di Regina; allora noi diciamo quelladonna pare una maest\xe0, ella ha una maest\xe0.\u201d\u2014Firenzuola: ",(0,n.kt)("em",{parentName:"p"},"DellaBellezza delle Donne"),"."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Tito had even been the means of strengthening the hope in Bardo\u2019s mindthat he might before his death receive the longed-for securityconcerning his library: that it should not be merged in anothercollection; that it should not be transferred to a body of monks, andbe called by the name of a monastery; but that it should remain forever the Bardi Library, for the use of Florentines. For the old habitof trusting in the Medici could not die out while their influence wasstill the strongest lever in the State; and Tito, once possessing theear of the Cardinal Giovanni de\u2019 Medici, might do more even than MesserBernardo towards winning the desired interest, for he could demonstrateto a learned audience the peculiar value of Bardi\u2019s collection.
