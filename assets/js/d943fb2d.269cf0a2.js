Then, leaning to kiss her on the brow, hesuggested that she should keep in her own room where the little paintedtabernacle was, and where she was then sitting, so that she might beaway from the noise of strange footsteps, Romola assented quietly,making no sign of emotion: the night had been one long waking to her,and, in spite of her healthy frame, sensation had become a dullcontinuous pain, as if she had been stunned and bruised. Tito divinedthat she felt ill, but he dared say no more; he only dared, perceivingthat her hand and brow were stone cold, to fetch a furred mantle andthrow it lightly round her. And in every brief interval that hereturned to her, the scene was nearly the same: he tried to propitiateher by some unobtrusive act or word of tenderness, and she seemed tohave lost the power of speaking to him, or of looking at him.\u201cPatience!\u201d he said to himself. \u201cShe will recover it, and forgive atlast. The tie to me must still remain the strongest.\u201d When the strickenperson is slow to recover and look as if nothing had happened, thestriker easily glides into the position of the aggrieved party; hefeels no bruise himself, and is strongly conscious of his own amiablebehaviour since he inflicted the blow. But Tito was not naturallydisposed to feel himself aggrieved; the constant bent of his mind wastowards propitiation, and he would have submitted to much for the sakeof feeling Romola\u2019s hand resting on his head again, as it did thatmorning when he first shrank from looking at her."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"But he found it the less difficult to wait patiently for the return ofhis home happiness, because his life out of doors was more and moreinteresting to him. A course of action which is in strictness aslowly-prepared outgrowth of the entire character, is yet almost alwaystraceable to a single impression as its point of apparent origin; andsince that moment in the Piazza del Duomo, when Tito, mounted on thebales, had tasted a keen pleasure in the consciousness of his abilityto tickle the ears of men with any phrases that pleased them, hisimagination had glanced continually towards a sort of politicalactivity which the troubled public life of Florence was likely enoughto find occasion for. But the fresh dread of Baldassarre, waked in thesame moment, had lain like an immovable rocky obstruction across thatpath, and had urged him into the sale of the library, as a preparationfor the possible necessity of leaving Florence, at the very time whenhe was beginning to feel that it had a new attraction for him.

Doctors of law disputed day after day, andfar on into the night. Messer Pagolantonio Soderini alleged excellentreasons on the side of the popular scheme; Messer Guidantonio Vespuccialleged reasons equally excellent on the side, of a more aristocraticform. It was a question of boiled or roast, which had been prejudged bythe palates of the disputants, and the excellent arguing might havebeen protracted a long while without any other result than that ofdeferring the cooking.
