By great exertions theMedicean party had so far triumphed, and that triumph had deepenedRomola\u2019s presentiment of some secretly-prepared scheme likely to ripeneither into success or betrayal during these two months of hergodfather\u2019s authority. Every morning the dim daybreak as it peered intoher room seemed to be that haunting fear coming back to her.

ForSavonarola was preaching\u2014preaching the last course of Lenten sermons hewas ever allowed to finish in the Duomo: he knew that excommunicationwas imminent, and he had reached the point of defying it. He held upthe condition of the Church in the terrible mirror of his unflinchingspeech, which called things by their right names and dealt in no politeperiphrases; he proclaimed with heightening confidence the advent ofrenovation\u2014of a moment when there would be a general revolt againstcorruption. As to his own destiny, he seemed to have a double andalternating prevision: sometimes he saw himself taking a glorious partin that revolt, sending forth a voice that would be heard through allChristendom, and making the dead body of the Church tremble into newlife, as the body of Lazarus trembled when the Divine voice pierced thesepulchre; sometimes he saw no prospect for himself but persecution andmartyrdom:\u2014this life for him was only a vigil, and only after deathwould come the dawn."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"The position was one which must have had its impressiveness for allminds that were not of the dullest order, even if they were inclined,as Macchiavelli was, to interpret the Frate\u2019s character by a key thatpresupposed no loftiness. To Romola, whose kindred ardour gave her afirm belief in Savonarola\u2019s genuine greatness of purpose, the crisiswas as stirring as if it had been part of her personal lot. It blentitself as an exalting memory with all her daily labours; and thoselabours were calling not only for difficult perseverance, but for newcourage. Famine had never yet taken its flight from Florence, and alldistress, by its long continuance, was getting harder to bear; diseasewas spreading in the crowded city, and the Plague was expected. AsRomola walked, often in weariness, among the sick, the hungry, and themurmuring, she felt it good to be inspired by something more than herpity\u2014by the belief in a heroism struggling for sublime ends, towardswhich the daily action of her pity could only tend feebly, as the dewsthat freshen the weedy ground to-day tend to prepare an unseen harvestin the years to come."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"But that mighty music which stirred her in the Duomo was not withoutits jarring notes. Since those first days of glowing hope when theFrate, seeing the near triumph of good in the reform of the Republicand the coming of the French deliverer, had preached peace, charity,and oblivion of political differences, there had been a marked changeof conditions: political intrigue had been too obstinate to allow ofthe desired oblivion; the belief in the French deliverer, who hadturned his back on his high mission, seemed to have wrought harm; andhostility, both on a petty and on a grand scale, was attacking theProphet with new weapons and new determination."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"It followed that the spirit of contention and self-vindication piercedmore and more conspicuously in his sermons; that he was urged to meetthe popular demands not only by increased insistence and detailconcerning visions and private revelations, but by a tone of defiantconfidence against objectors; and from having denounced the desire forthe miraculous, and declared that miracles had no relation to truefaith, he had come to assert that at the right moment the Divine powerwould attest the truth of his prophetic preaching by a miracle.

He went the more because he had seen that Romola wenttoo; for he was waiting and watching for a time when not only outwardcircumstances, but his own varying mental state, would mark the rightmoment for seeking an interview with her. Twice Romola had caught sightof his face in the Duomo\u2014once when its dark glance was fixed on hers.She wished not to see it again, and yet she looked for it, as men lookfor the reappearance of a portent.

Romola, whoshrank with unconquerable repulsion from the shrill volubility of thoseilluminated women, and had just now a special repugnance towardsCamilla because of a report that she had announced revelations hostileto Bernardo del Nero, was at first inclined to send back a flatrefusal. Camilla\u2019s message might refer to public affairs, and Romola\u2019simmediate prompting was to close her ears against knowledge that mightonly make her mental burden heavier.

Theexhortation was not yet ended when she started up and attempted towrench her arm from Camilla\u2019s tightening grasp. It was of no use. Theprophetess kept her hold like a crab, and, only incited to more eagerexhortation by Romola\u2019s resistance, was carried beyond her ownintention into a shrill statement of other visions which were tocorroborate this.

Still, since he knew the possibly fataleffects of visions like Camilla\u2019s, since he had a marked distrust ofsuch spirit-seeing women, and kept aloof from them as much as possible,why, with his readiness to denounce wrong from the pulpit, did he notpublicly denounce these pretended revelations which brought newdarkness instead of light across the conception of a Supreme Will? Why?The answer came with painful clearness: he was fettered inwardly by theconsciousness that such revelations were not, in their basis,distinctly separable from his own visions; he was fettered outwardly bythe foreseen consequence of raising a cry against himself even amongmembers of his own party, as one who would suppress all Divineinspiration of which he himself was not the vehicle\u2014he or hisconfidential and supplementary seer of visions, Fra Salvestro."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Romola, kneeling with buried face on the altar-step, was enduring oneof those sickening moments, when the enthusiasm which had come to heras the only energy strong enough to make life worthy, seemed to beinevitably bound up with vain dreams and wilful eye-shutting.

But at this moment the assent ofher understanding went alone; it was given unwillingly. Her heart wasrecoiling from a right allied to so much narrowness; a right apparentlyentailing that hard systematic judgment of men which measures them byassents and denials quite superficial to the manhood within them.

But now a sudden insurrection of feeling hadbrought about that collision. Her indignation, once roused by Camilla\u2019svisions, could not pause there, but ran like an illuminating fire overall the kindred facts in Savonarola\u2019s teaching, and for the moment shefelt what was true in the scornful sarcasms she heard continually flungagainst him, more keenly than she felt what was false."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"But it was an illumination that made all life look ghastly to her.Where were the beings to whom she could cling, with whom she could workand endure, with the belief that she was working for the right?
