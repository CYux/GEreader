Why should she careabout wearing one badge more than another, or about being called by herown name? She despaired of finding any consistent duty belonging tothat name.

The impulse to setherself free had risen again with overmastering force; yet the freedomcould only be an exchange of calamity.

The vision of any great purpose, any end ofexistence which could ennoble endurance and exalt the common deeds of adusty life with divine ardours, was utterly eclipsed for her now by thesense of a confusion in human things which made all effort a meredragging at tangled threads; all fellowship, either for resistance oradvocacy, mere unfairness and exclusiveness. What, after all, was theman who had represented for her the highest heroism: the heroism not ofhard, self-contained endurance, but of willing, self-offering love?What was the cause he was struggling for? Romola had lost her trust inSavonarola, had lost that fervour of admiration which had made herunmindful of his aberrations, and attentive only to the grand curve ofhis orbit. And now that her keen feeling for her godfather had thrownher into antagonism with the Frate, she saw all the repulsive andinconsistent details in his teaching with a painful lucidity whichexaggerated their proportions. In the bitterness of her disappointmentshe said that his striving after the renovation of the Church and theworld was a striving after a mere name which told no more than thetitle of a book: a name that had come to mean practically the measuresthat would strengthen his own position in Florence; nay, oftenquestionable deeds and words, for the sake of saving his influence fromsuffering by his own errors.

Inthat declaration of his, that the cause of his party was the cause ofGod\u2019s kingdom, she heard only the ring of egoism. Perhaps such wordshave rarely been uttered without that meaner ring in them; yet they arethe implicit formula of all energetic belief. And if such energeticbelief, pursuing a grand and remote end, is often in danger of becominga demon-worship, in which the votary lets his son and daughter passthrough the fire with a readiness that hardly looks like sacrifice;tender fellow-feeling for the nearest has its danger too, and is apt tobe timid and sceptical towards the larger aims without which lifecannot rise into religion.

With thesinking of high human trust, the dignity of life sinks too; we cease tobelieve in our own better self, since that also is part of the commonnature which is degraded in our thought; and all the finer impulses ofthe soul are dulled.

In her longing to glideover the waters that were getting golden with the level sun-rays, shethought of a story which had been one of the things she had loved todwell on in Boccaccio, when her father fell asleep and she glided fromher stool to sit on the floor and read the \u2018Decamerone.\u2019 It was thestory of that fair Gostanza who in her lovelorn-ness desired to live nolonger, but not having the courage to attack her young life, had putherself into a boat and pushed off to sea; then, lying down in theboat, had wrapt her mantle round her head, hoping to be wrecked, sothat her fear would be helpless to flee from death. The memory hadremained a mere thought in Romola\u2019s mind, without budding into anydistinct wish; but now, as she paused again in her walking to and fro,she saw gliding black against the red gold another boat with one man init, making towards the bend where the first and smaller boat wasmoored. Walking on again, she at length saw the man land, pull his boatashore and begin to unload something from it. He was perhaps the ownerof the smaller boat also: he would be going away soon, and heropportunity would be gone with him\u2014her opportunity of buying thatsmaller boat.

But he had not yetsold the old one. Romola asked him how much it was worth, and then,while he was busy, thrust the price into a little satchel lying on theground and containing the remnant of his dinner. After that, shewatched him furling his sail and asked him how he should set it if hewanted to go out to sea, and then pacing up and down again, waited tosee him depart."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"The imagination of herself gliding away in that boat on the darkeningwaters was growing more and more into a longing, as the thought of acool brook in sultriness becomes a painful thirst. To be freed from theburden of choice when all motive was bruised, to commit herself,sleeping, to destiny which would either bring death or else newnecessities that might rouse a new life in her!\u2014it was a thought thatbeckoned her the more because the soft evening air made her long torest in the still solitude, instead of going back to the noise and heatof the village."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"At last the slow fisherman had gathered up all his movables and waswalking away. Soon the gold was shrinking and getting duskier in seaand sky, and there was no living thing in sight, no sound but thelulling monotony of the lapping waves. In this sea there was no tidethat would help to carry her away if she waited for its ebb; but Romolathought the breeze from the land was rising a little. She got into theboat, unfurled the sail, and fastened it as she had learned in thatfirst brief lesson. She saw that it caught the light breeze, and thiswas all she cared for. Then she loosed the boat from its moorings, andtried to urge it with an oar, till she was far out from the land, tillthe sea was dark even to the west, and the stars were disclosingthemselves like a palpitating life over the wide heavens. Resting atlast, she threw back her cowl, and, taking off the kerchief underneath,which confined her hair, she doubled them both under her head for apillow on one of the boat\u2019s ribs.
