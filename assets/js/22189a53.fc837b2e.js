Folly! suchvague memories hang about the mind like cobwebs, with ticklingimportunity\u2014best to sweep them away at a dash: and Tito had pleasanteroccupation for his thoughts. By the time he was turning out of theCorso degli Adimari into a side-street he was caring only that the sunwas high, and that the procession had kept him longer than he hadintended from his visit to that room in the Via de\u2019 Bardi, where hiscoming, he knew, was anxiously awaited. He felt the scene of hisentrance beforehand: the joy beaming diffusedly in the blind face likethe light in a semi-transparent lamp; the transient pink flush onRomola\u2019s face and neck, which subtracted nothing from her majesty, butonly gave it the exquisite charm of womanly sensitiveness, heightenedstill more by what seemed the paradoxical boy-like frankness of herlook and smile. They were the best comrades in the world during thehours they passed together round the blind man\u2019s chair: she wasconstantly appealing to Tito, and he was informing her, yet he felthimself strangely in subjection to Romola with that simplicity of hers:he felt for the first time, without defining it to himself, that lovingawe in the presence of noble womanhood, which is perhaps something likethe worship paid of old to a great nature-goddess, who was notall-knowing, but whose life and power were something deeper and moreprimordial than knowledge. They had never been alone together, and hecould frame to himself no probable image of love-scenes between them:he could only fancy and wish wildly\u2014what he knew was impossible\u2014thatRomola would some day tell him that she loved him. One day in Greece,as he was leaning over a wall in the sunshine, a little black-eyedpeasant girl, who had rested her water-pot on the wall, crept graduallynearer and nearer to him, and at last shyly asked him to kiss her,putting up her round olive cheek very innocently. Tito was used to lovethat came in this unsought fashion. But Romola\u2019s love would never comein that way: would it ever come at all?\u2014and yet it was that topmostapple on which he had set his mind. He was in his fresh youth\u2014notpassionate, but impressible: it was as inevitable that he should feellovingly towards Romola as that the white irises should be reflected inthe clear sunlit stream; but he had no coxcombry, and he had anintimate sense that Romola was something very much above him.

His first auspiciousinterview with Bartolommeo Scala had proved the commencement of agrowing favour on the secretary\u2019s part, and had led to an issue whichwould have been enough to make Tito decide on Florence as the place inwhich to establish himself, even if it had held no other magnet.Politian was professor of Greek as well as Latin at Florence,professorial chairs being maintained there, although the university hadbeen removed to Pisa; but for a long time Demetrio Calcondila, one ofthe most eminent and respectable among the emigrant Greeks, had alsoheld a Greek chair, simultaneously with the too predominant Italian.Calcondila was now gone to Milan, and there was no counterpoise orrival to Politian such as was desired for him by the friends who wishedhim to be taught a little propriety and humility. Scala was far frombeing the only friend of this class, and he found several who, if theywere not among those thirsty admirers of mediocrity that were glad tobe refreshed with his verses in hot weather, were yet quite willing tojoin him in doing that moral service to Politian. It was finally agreedthat Tito should be supported in a Greek chair, as Demetrio Calcondilahad been by Lorenzo himself, who, being at the same time theaffectionate patron of Politian, had shown by precedent that there wasnothing invidious in such a measure, but only a zeal for true learningand for the instruction of the Florentine youth."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"Tito was thus sailing under the fairest breeze, and besides convincingfair judges that his talents squared with his good fortune, he worethat fortune so easily and unpretentiously that no one had yet beenoffended by it.

For wherecould a handsome young scholar not be welcome when he could touch thelute and troll a gay song? That bright face, that easy smile, thatliquid voice, seemed to give life a holiday aspect; just as a strain ofgay music and the hoisting of colours make the work-worn and the sadrather ashamed of showing themselves.
