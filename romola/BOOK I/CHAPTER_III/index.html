In Chapter III of &quot;Romola&quot; by George Eliot, the young Greek stranger meets Nello, a loquacious and well-informed barber in Florence. As they walk together through the city, Nello shares his insights on the local culture, politics, and art, as well as the scholarly prejudices against Greeks. Nello suggests that Bartolommeo Scala, the secretary of the Republic, may be a potential patron for the Greek stranger, who is looking to sell some of his gems. Nello also mentions another man, Bardo de&#x27; Bardi, who has a beautiful daughter named Romola but is blind and has no money to buy the Greek&#x27;s gems. While discussing these potential patrons, they encounter some clients who may be able to help the Greek stranger with his ring.</p><p><strong>Main Characters</strong>:

[]</p></div></div><p>CHAPTER III.The Barber’s Shop.</p><p>“To tell you the truth,” said the young stranger to Nello, as they gota little clearer of the entangled vehicles and mules, “I am not sorryto be handed over by that patron of mine to one who has a lessbarbarous accent, and a less enigmatical business. Is it a common thingamong you Florentines for an itinerant trafficker in broken glass andrags to talk of a shop where he sells lutes and swords?”</p><p>“Common? No: our Bratti is not a common man. He has a theory, and livesup to it, which is more than I can say for any philosopher I have thehonour of shaving,” answered Nello, whose loquacity, like an over-fullbottle, could never pour forth a small dose. “Bratti means to extractthe utmost possible amount of pleasure, that is to say, of hardbargaining, out of this life; winding it up with a bargain for theeasiest possible passage through purgatory, by giving Holy Church hiswinnings when the game is over. He has had his will made to that effecton the cheapest terms a notary could be got for. But I have often saidto him, ‘Bratti, thy bargain is a limping one, and thou art on the lameside of it. Does it not make thee a little sad to look at the picturesof the Paradiso? Thou wilt never be able there to chaffer for rags andrusty nails: the saints and angels want neither pins nor tinder; andexcept with San Bartolommeo, who carries his skin about in aninconvenient manner, I see no chance of thy making a bargain forsecond-hand clothing.’ But God pardon me,” added Nello, changing histone, and crossing himself, “this light talk ill beseems a morning whenLorenzo lies dead, and the Muses are tearing their hair—always apainful thought to a barber; and you yourself, Messere, are probablyunder a cloud, for when a man of your speech and presence takes up withso sorry a night’s lodging, it argues some misfortune to have befallenhim.”</p><p>“What Lorenzo is that whose death you speak of?” said the stranger,appearing to have dwelt with too anxious an interest on this point tohave noticed the indirect inquiry that followed it.</p><p>“What Lorenzo? There is but one Lorenzo, I imagine, whose death couldthrow the Mercato into an uproar, set the lantern of the Duomo leapingin desperation, and cause the lions of the Republic to feel under animmediate necessity to devour one another. I mean Lorenzo de’ Medici,the Pericles of our Athens—if I may make such a comparison in the earof a Greek.”</p><p>“Why not?” said the other, laughingly; “for I doubt whether Athens,even in the days of Pericles, could have produced so learned a barber.”</p><p>“Yes, yes; I thought I could not be mistaken,” said the rapid Nello,“else I have shaved the venerable Demetrio Calcondila to littlepurpose; but pardon me, I am lost in wonder: your Italian is betterthan his, though he has been in Italy forty years—better even than thatof the accomplished Marullo, who may be said to have married the ItalicMuse in more senses than one, since he has married our learned andlovely Alessandra Scala.”</p><p>“It will lighten your wonder to know that I come of a Greek stockplanted in Italian soil much longer than the mulberry-trees which havetaken so kindly to it. I was born at Bari, and my—I mean, I was broughtup by an Italian—and, in fact, I am a Greek, very much as your peachesare Persian. The Greek dye was subdued in me, I suppose, till I hadbeen dipped over again by long abode and much travel in the land ofgods and heroes. And, to confess something of my private affairs toyou, this same Greek dye, with a few ancient gems I have about me, isthe only fortune shipwreck has left me. But—when the towers fall, youknow it is an ill business for the small nest-builders—the death ofyour Pericles makes me wish I had rather turned my steps towards Rome,as I should have done but for a fallacious Minerva in the shape of anAugustinian monk. ‘At Rome,’ he said, ‘you will be lost in a crowd ofhungry scholars; but at Florence, every corner is penetrated by thesunshine of Lorenzo’s patronage: Florence is the best market in Italyfor such commodities as yours.’”</p><p>“<em>Gnaffè</em>, and so it will remain, I hope,” said Nello, “Lorenzo was notthe only patron and judge of learning in our city—heaven forbid!Because he was a large melon, every other Florentine is not a pumpkin,I suppose. Have we not Bernardo Rucellai, and Alamanno Rinuccini, andplenty more? And if you want to be informed on such matters, I, Nello,am your man. It seems to me a thousand years till I can be of serviceto a <em>bel erudito</em> like yourself. And, first of all, in the matter ofyour hair. That beard, my fine young man, must be parted with, were itas dear to you as the nymph of your dreams. Here at Florence, we lovenot to see a man with his nose projecting over a cascade of hair. But,remember, you will have passed the Rubicon, when once you have beenshaven: if you repent, and let your beard grow after it has acquiredstoutness by a struggle with the razor, your mouth will by-and-by showno longer what Messer Angelo calls the divine prerogative of lips, butwill appear like a dark cavern fringed with horrent brambles.”</p><p>“That is a terrible prophecy,” said the Greek, “especially if yourFlorentine maidens are many of them as pretty as the little Tessa Istole a kiss from this morning.”</p><p>“Tessa? she is a rough-handed contadina: you will rise into the favourof dames who bring no scent of the mule-stables with them. But to thatend, you must not have the air of a <em>sgherro</em>, or a man of evil repute:you must look like a courtier, and a scholar of the more polished sort,such as our Pietro Crinito—like one who sins among well-bred, well-fedpeople, and not one who sucks down vile <em>vino di sotto</em> in a chancetavern.”</p><p>“With all my heart,” said the stranger. “If the Florentine Gracesdemand it, I am willing to give up this small matter of my beard, but—”</p><p>“Yes, yes,” interrupted Nello. “I know what you would say. It is the<em>bella zazzera</em>—the hyacinthine locks, you do not choose to part with;and there is no need. Just a little pruning—ecco!—and you will look notunlike the illustrious prince Pico di Mirandola in his prime. And herewe are in good time in the Piazza San Giovanni, and at the door of myshop. But you are pausing, I see: naturally, you want to look at ourwonder of the world, our Duomo, our Santa Maria del Fiore. Well, well,a mere glance; but I beseech you to leave a closer survey till you havebeen shaved: I am quivering with the inspiration of my art even to thevery edge of my razor. Ah, then, come round this way.”</p><p>The mercurial barber seized the arm of the stranger, and led him to apoint, on the south side of the piazza, from which he could see at oncethe huge dark shell of the cupola, the slender soaring grace ofGiotto’s campanile, and the quaint octagon of San Giovanni in front ofthem, showing its unique gates of storied bronze, which still bore thesomewhat dimmed glory of their original gilding. The inlaid marbleswere then fresher in their pink, and white, and purple, than they arenow, when the winters of four centuries have turned their white to therich ochre of well-mellowed meerschaum; the façade of the cathedral didnot stand ignominious in faded stucco, but had upon it the magnificentpromise of the half-completed marble inlaying and statued niches, whichGiotto had devised a hundred and fifty years before; and as thecampanile in all its harmonious variety of colour and form led the eyesupward, high into the clear air of this April morning, it seemed aprophetic symbol, telling that human life must somehow and some timeshape itself into accord with that pure aspiring beauty.</p><p>But this was not the impression it appeared to produce on the Greek.His eyes were irresistibly led upward, but as he stood with his armsfolded and his curls falling backward, there was a slight touch ofscorn on his lip, and when his eyes fell again they glanced round witha scanning coolness which was rather piquing to Nello’s Florentinespirit.</p><p>“Well, my fine young man,” he said, with some impatience, “you seem tomake as little of our Cathedral as if you were the Angel Gabriel comestraight from Paradise. I should like to know if you have ever seenfiner work than our Giotto’s tower, or any cupola that would not look amere mushroom by the side of Brunelleschi’s there, or any marbles fineror more cunningly wrought than these that our Signoria got from far-offquarries, at a price that would buy a dukedom. Come, now, have you everseen anything to equal them?”</p><p>“If you asked me that question with a scimitar at my throat, after theTurkish fashion, or even your own razor,” said the young Greek, smilinggaily, and moving on towards the gates of the Baptistery, “I daresayyou might get a confession of the true faith from me. But with mythroat free from peril, I venture to tell you that your buildings smacktoo much of Christian barbarism for my taste. I have a shuddering senseof what there is inside—hideous smoked Madonnas; fleshless saints inmosaic, staring down idiotic astonishment and rebuke from the apse;skin-clad skeletons hanging on crosses, or stuck all over with arrows,or stretched on gridirons; women and monks with heads aside inperpetual lamentation. I have seen enough of those wry-neckedfavourites of heaven at Constantinople. But what is this bronze doorrough with imagery? These women’s figures seem moulded in a differentspirit from those starved and staring saints I spoke of: these heads inhigh relief speak of a human mind within them, instead of looking likean index to perpetual spasms and colic.”</p><p>“Yes, yes,” said Nello, with some triumph. “I think we shall show youby-and-by that our Florentine art is not in a state of barbarism. Thesegates, my fine young man, were moulded half a century ago, by ourLorenzo Ghiberti, when he counted hardly so many years as you do.”</p><p>“Ah, I remember,” said the stranger, turning away, like one whoseappetite for contemplation was soon satisfied. “I have heard that yourTuscan sculptors and painters have been studying the antique a little.But with monks for models, and the legends of mad hermits and martyrsfor subjects, the vision of Olympus itself would be of small use tothem.”</p><p>“I understand,” said Nello, with a significant shrug, as they walkedalong. “You are of the same mind as Michele Marullo, ay, and as AngeloPoliziano himself, in spite of his canonicate, when he relaxes himselfa little in my shop after his lectures, and talks of the gods awakingfrom their long sleep and making the woods and streams vital once more.But he rails against the Roman scholars who want to make us all talkLatin again: ‘My ears,’ he says, ‘are sufficiently flayed by thebarbarisms of the learned, and if the vulgar are to talk Latin I wouldas soon have been in Florence the day they took to beating all thekettles in the city because the bells were not enough to stay the wrathof the saints.’ Ah, Messer Greco, if you want to know the flavour ofour scholarship, you must frequent my shop: it is the focus ofFlorentine intellect, and in that sense the navel of the earth—as mygreat predecessor, Burchiello, said of <em>his</em> shop, on the morefrivolous pretension that his street of the Calimara was the centre ofour city. And here we are at the sign of ‘Apollo and the Razor.’Apollo, you see, is bestowing the razor on the Triptolemus of ourcraft, the first reaper of beards, the sublime <em>Anonimo</em>, whosemysterious identity is indicated by a shadowy hand.”</p><p>“I see thou hast had custom already, Sandro,” continued Nello,addressing a solemn-looking dark-eyed youth, who made way for them onthe threshold. “And now make all clear for this signor to sit down. Andprepare the finest-scented lather, for he has a learned and a handsomechin.”</p><p>“You have a pleasant little adytum there, I see,” said the stranger,looking through a latticed screen which divided the shop from a room ofabout equal size, opening into a still smaller walled enclosure, wherea few bays and laurels surrounded a stone Hermes. “I suppose yourconclave of <em>eruditi</em> meets there?”</p><p>“There, and not less in my shop,” said Nello, leading the way into theinner room, in which were some benches, a table, with one book inmanuscript and one printed in capitals lying open upon it, a lute, afew oil-sketches, and a model or two of hands and ancient masks. “Formy shop is a no less fitting haunt of the Muses, as you willacknowledge when you feel the sudden illumination of understanding andthe serene vigour of inspiration that will come to you with a clearchin. Ah! you can make that lute discourse, I perceive. I, too, havesome skill that way, though the serenata is useless when daylightdiscloses a visage like mine, looking no fresher than an apple that hasstood the winter. But look at that sketch: it is a fancy of Piero diCosimo’s, a strange freakish painter, who says he saw it by longlooking at a mouldy wall.”</p><p>The sketch Nello pointed to represented three masks—one a drunkenlaughing Satyr, another a sorrowing Magdalen, and the third, which laybetween them, the rigid, cold face of a Stoic: the masks restedobliquely on the lap of a little child, whose cherub features roseabove them with something of the supernal promise in the gaze whichpainters had by that time learned to give to the Divine Infant.</p><p>“A symbolical picture, I see,” said the young Greek, touching the lutewhile he spoke, so as to bring out a slight musical murmur. “The child,perhaps, is the Golden Age, wanting neither worship nor philosophy. Andthe Golden Age can always come back as long as men are born in the formof babies, and don’t come into the world in cassock or furred mantle.Or, the child may mean the wise philosophy of Epicurus, removed alikefrom the gross, the sad, and the severe.”</p><p>“Ah! everybody has his own interpretation for that picture,” saidNello; “and if you ask Piero himself what he meant by it, he says hispictures are an appendix which Messer Domeneddio has been pleased tomake to the universe, and if any man is in doubt what they mean, he hadbetter inquire of Holy Church. He has been asked to paint a pictureafter the sketch, but he puts his fingers to his ears and shakes hishead at that; the fancy is past, he says—a strange animal, our Piero.But now all is ready for your initiation into the mysteries of therazor.”</p><p>“Mysteries they may well be called,” continued the barber, with risingspirits at the prospect of a long monologue, as he imprisoned the youngGreek in the shroud-like shaving-cloth; “mysteries of Minerva and theGraces. I get the flower of men’s thoughts, because I seize them in thefirst moment after shaving. (Ah! you wince a little at the lather: ittickles the outlying limits of the nose, I admit.) And that is whatmakes the peculiar fitness of a barber’s shop to become a resort of witand learning. For, look now at a druggist’s shop: there is a dullconclave at the sign of ‘The Moor,’ that pretends to rival mine; butwhat sort of inspiration, I beseech you, can be got from the scent ofnauseous vegetable decoctions?—to say nothing of the fact that you nosooner pass the threshold than you see a doctor of physic, like agigantic spider disguised in fur and scarlet, waiting for his prey; oreven see him blocking up the doorway seated on a bony hack, inspectingsaliva. (Your chin a little elevated, if it please you: contemplatethat angel who is blowing the trumpet at you from the ceiling. I had itpainted expressly for the regulation of my clients’ chins.) Besides,your druggist, who herborises and decocts, is a man of prejudices: hehas poisoned people according to a system, and is obliged to stand upfor his system to justify the consequences. Now a barber can bedispassionate; the only thing he necessarily stands by is the razor,always providing he is not an author. That was the flaw in my greatpredecessor Burchiello: he was a poet, and had consequently a prejudiceabout his own poetry. I have escaped that; I saw very early thatauthorship is a narrowing business, in conflict with the liberal art ofthe razor, which demands an impartial affection for all men’s chins.Ecco, Messer! the outline of your chin and lip is as clear as amaiden’s; and now fix your mind on a knotty question—ask yourselfwhether you are bound to spell Virgil with an <em>i</em> or an <em>e</em>, and say ifyou do not feel an unwonted clearness on the point. Only, if you decidefor the <em>i</em>, keep it to yourself till your fortune is made, for the <em>e_hath the stronger following in Florence. Ah! I think I see a gleam ofstill quicker wit in your eye. I have it on the authority of our youngNiccolò Macchiavelli, himself keen enough to discern _il pelo nell’uovo</em>, as we say, and a great lover of delicate shaving, though hisbeard is hardly of two years’ date, that no sooner do the hairs beginto push themselves, than he perceives a certain grossness ofapprehension creeping over him.”</p><p>“Suppose you let me look at myself,” said the stranger, laughing. “Thehappy effect on my intellect is perhaps obstructed by a little doubt asto the effect on my appearance.”</p><p>“Behold yourself in this mirror, then; it is a Venetian mirror fromMurano, the true <em>nosce teipsum</em>, as I have named it, compared withwhich the finest mirror of steel or silver is mere darkness. See now,how by diligent shaving, the nether region of your face may preserveits human outline, instead of presenting no distinction from thephysiognomy of a bearded owl or a Barbary ape. I have seen men whosebeards have so invaded their cheeks, that one might have pitied them asthe victims of a sad, brutalising chastisement befitting our Dante’sInferno, if they had not seemed to strut with a strange triumph intheir extravagant hairiness.”</p><p>“It seems to me,” said the Greek, still looking into the mirror, “thatyou have taken away some of my capital with your razor—I mean a year ortwo of age, which might have won me more ready credit for my learning.Under the inspection of a patron whose vision has grown somewhat dim, Ishall have a perilous resemblance to a maiden of eighteen in thedisguise of hose and jerkin.”</p><p>“Not at all,” said Nello, proceeding to clip the too extravagant curls;“your proportions are not those of a maiden. And for your age, I myselfremember seeing Angelo Poliziano begin his lectures on the Latinlanguage when he had a younger beard than yours; and between ourselves,his juvenile ugliness was not less signal than his precociousscholarship. Whereas you—no, no, your age is not against you; butbetween ourselves, let me hint to you that your being a Greek, thoughit be only an Apulian Greek, is not in your favour. Certain of ourscholars hold that your Greek learning is but a wayside degenerateplant until it has been transplanted into Italian brains, and that nowthere is such a plentiful crop of the superior quality, your nativeteachers are mere propagators of degeneracy. Ecco! your curls are nowof the right proportion to neck and shoulders; rise, Messer, and I willfree you from the encumbrance of this cloth. <em>Gnaffè</em>! I almost adviseyou to retain the faded jerkin and hose a little longer; they give youthe air of a fallen prince.”</p><p>“But the question is,” said the young Greek, leaning against the highback of a chair, and returning Nello’s contemplative admiration with alook of inquiring anxiety; “the question is, in what quarter I am tocarry my princely air, so as to rise from the said fallen condition. Ifyour Florentine patrons of learning share this scholarly hostility tothe Greeks, I see not how your city can be a hospitable refuge for me,as you seemed to say just now.”</p><p>“<em>Pian piano</em>—not so fast,” said Nello, sticking his thumbs into hisbelt and nodding to Sandro to restore order. “I will not conceal fromyou that there is a prejudice against Greeks among us; and though, as abarber unsnared by authorship, I share no prejudices, I must admit thatthe Greeks are not always such pretty youngsters as yourself: theirerudition is often of an uncombed, unmannerly aspect, and encrustedwith a barbarous utterance of Italian, that makes their converse hardlymore euphonious than that of a Tedesco in a state of vinous loquacity.And then, again, excuse me—we Florentines have liberal ideas aboutspeech, and consider that an instrument which can flatter and promiseso cleverly as the tongue, must have been partly made for thosepurposes; and that truth is a riddle for eyes and wit to discover,which it were a mere spoiling of sport for the tongue to betray. Stillwe have our limits beyond which we call dissimulation treachery. But itis said of the Greeks that their honesty begins at what is the hangingpoint with us, and that since the old Furies went to sleep, yourChristian Greek is of so easy a conscience that he would make astepping-stone of his father’s corpse.”</p><p>The flush on the stranger’s face indicated what seemed so natural amovement of resentment, that the good-natured Nello hastened to atonefor his want of reticence.</p><p>“Be not offended, <em>bel giovane</em>; I am but repeating what I hear in myshop; as you may perceive, my eloquence is simply the cream which Iskim off my clients’ talk. Heaven forbid I should fetter myimpartiality by entertaining an opinion. And for that same scholarlyobjection to the Greeks,” added Nello, in a more mocking tone, and witha significant grimace, “the fact is, you are heretics, Messer; jealousyhas nothing to do with it: if you would just change your opinion aboutleaven, and alter your Doxology a little, our Italian scholars wouldthink it a thousand years till they could give up their chairs to you.Yes, yes; it is chiefly religious scruple, and partly also theauthority of a great classic,—Juvenal, is it not? He, I gather, had hisbile as much stirred by the swarm of Greeks as our Messer Angelo, whois fond of quoting some passage about their incorrigibleimpudence—<em>audacia perdita</em>.”</p><p>“Pooh! the passage is a compliment,” said the Greek, who had recoveredhimself, and seemed wise enough to take the matter gaily—</p><p>“‘Ingenium velox, audacia perdita, sermoPromptus, et Isaeo torrentior.’</p><p>“A rapid intellect and ready eloquence may carry off a littleimpudence.”</p><p>“Assuredly,” said Nello. “And since, as I see, you know Latinliterature as well as Greek, you will not fall into the mistake ofGiovanni Argiropulo, who ran full tilt against Cicero, and pronouncedhim all but a pumpkin-head. For, let me give you one bit of advice,young man—trust a barber who has shaved the best chins, and kept hiseyes and ears open for twenty years—oil your tongue well when you talkof the ancient Latin writers, and give it an extra dip when you talk ofthe modern. A wise Greek may win favour among us; witness our excellentDemetrio, who is loved by many, and not hated immoderately even by themost renowned scholars.”</p><p>“I discern the wisdom of your advice so clearly,” said the Greek, withthe bright smile which was continually lighting up the fine form andcolour of his young face, “that I will ask you for a little more. Whonow, for example, would be the most likely patron for me? Is there ason of Lorenzo who inherits his tastes? Or is there any other wealthyFlorentine specially addicted to purchasing antique gems? I have a fineCleopatra cut in sardonyx, and one or two other intaglios and cameos,both curious and beautiful, worthy of being added to the cabinet of aprince. Happily, I had taken the precaution of fastening them withinthe lining of my doublet before I set out on my voyage. Moreover, Ishould like to raise a small sum for my present need on this ring ofmine,” (here he took out the ring and replaced it on his finger), “ifyou could recommend me to any honest trafficker.”</p><p>“Let us see, let us see,” said Nello, perusing the floor, and walkingup and down the length of his shop. “This is no time to apply to Pierode’ Medici, though he has the will to make such purchases if he couldalways spare the money; but I think it is another sort of Cleopatrathat he covets most... Yes, yes, I have it. What you want is a man ofwealth, and influence, and scholarly tastes—not one of your learnedporcupines, bristling all over with critical tests, but one whose Greekand Latin are of a comfortable laxity. And that man is BartolommeoScala, the secretary of our Republic. He came to Florence as a pooradventurer himself—a miller’s son—a ‘branny monster,’ as he has beennicknamed by our honey-lipped Poliziano, who agrees with him as well asmy teeth agree with lemon-juice. And, by the by, that may be a reasonwhy the secretary may be the more ready to do a good turn to a strangescholar. For, between you and me, <em>bel giovane</em>—trust a barber who hasshaved the best scholars—friendliness is much such a steed as SerBenghi’s: it will hardly show much alacrity unless it has got thethistle of hatred under its tail. However, the secretary is a manwho’ll keep his word to you, even to the halving of a fennel-seed; andhe is not unlikely to buy some of your gems.”</p><p>“But how am I to get at this great man?” said the Greek, ratherimpatiently.</p><p>“I was coming to that,” said Nello. “Just now everybody of any publicimportance will be full of Lorenzo’s death, and a stranger may find itdifficult to get any notice. But in the meantime, I could take you to aman who, if he has a mind, can help you to a chance of a favourableinterview with Scala sooner than anybody else in Florence—worth seeingfor his own sake too, to say nothing of his collections, or of hisdaughter Romola, who is as fair as the Florentine lily before it gotquarrelsome and turned red.”</p><p>“But if this father of the beautiful Romola makes collections, whyshould he not like to buy some of my gems himself?”</p><p>Nello shrugged his shoulders. “For two good reasons—want of sight tolook at the gems, and want of money to pay for them. Our old Bardo de’Bardi is so blind that he can see no more of his daughter than, as hesays, a glimmering of something bright when she comes very near him:doubtless her golden hair, which, as Messer Luigi Pulci says of hisMeridiana’s, ‘<em>raggia come stella per sereno</em>.’ Ah! here come someclients of mine, and I shouldn’t wonder if one of them could serve yourturn about that ring.”</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/CYux/GEreader/tree/main/docs/romola/BOOK I/3_CHAPTER_III.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/GEreader/romola/BOOK I/CHAPTER_II"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">II.
