In this chapter, Tito Melema is introduced to Bardo, Romola&#x27;s blind father, by Nello, the barber. Bardo is impressed by Tito&#x27;s learning and his travels in Greece. They discuss the possibility of Tito writing a book about his experiences, and Bardo offers to help him. They also discuss Tito&#x27;s gems and Bardo suggests that Tito visit Bartolommeo Scala, a wealthy man who collects gems. Just as they are about to discuss the gems further, Bernardo del Nero, a family friend, enters the room. Tito takes his leave, and Bernardo warns Bardo to be cautious with Tito, suggesting that he may have ulterior motives. Bardo considers the warning and begins to think about the possibility of Tito marrying Romola.</p><p><strong>Main Characters</strong>:

There was only one masculine face, atonce youthful and beautiful, the image of which remained deeplyimpressed on her mind: it was that of her brother, who long years agohad taken her on his knee, kissed her, and never come back again: afair face, with sunny hair, like her own. But the habitual attitude ofher mind towards strangers—a proud self-dependence and determination toask for nothing even by a smile—confirmed in her by her father’scomplaints against the world’s injustice, was like a snowy embankmenthemming in the rush of admiring surprise. Tito’s bright face showed itsrich-tinted beauty without any rivalry of colour above his black _sajo_or tunic reaching to the knees. It seemed like a wreath of spring,dropped suddenly in Romola’s young but wintry life, which had inheritednothing but memories—memories of a dead mother, of a lost brother, of ablind father’s happier time—memories of far-off light, love, andbeauty, that lay embedded in dark mines of books, and could hardly giveout their brightness again until they were kindled for her by the torchof some known joy. Nevertheless, she returned Tito’s bow, made to heron entering, with the same pale proud face as ever; but, as heapproached, the snow melted, and when he ventured to look towards heragain, while Nello was speaking, a pink flush overspread her face, tovanish again almost immediately, as if her imperious will had recalledit. Tito’s glance, on the contrary, had that gentle, beseechingadmiration in it which is the most propitiating of appeals to a proud,shy woman, and is perhaps the only atonement a man can make for beingtoo handsome. The finished fascination of his air came chiefly from theabsence of demand and assumption. It was that of a fleet, soft-coated,dark-eyed animal that delights you by not bounding away in indifferencefrom you, and unexpectedly pillows its chin on your palm, and looks upat you desiring to be stroked—as if it loved you.</p><p>“Messere, I give you welcome,” said Bardo, with some condescension;“misfortune wedded to learning, and especially to Greek learning, is aletter of credit that should win the ear of every instructedFlorentine; for, as you are doubtless aware, since the period when yourcountryman, Manuelo Crisolora, diffused the light of his teaching inthe chief cities of Italy, now nearly a century ago, no man is heldworthy of the name of scholar who has acquired merely the transplantedand derivative literature of the Latins; rather, such inert studentsare stigmatised as <em>opici</em> or barbarians according to the phrase of theRomans themselves, who frankly replenished their urns at thefountain-head. I am, as you perceive, and as Nello has doubtlessforewarned you, totally blind: a calamity to which we Florentines areheld especially liable, whether owing to the cold winds which rush uponus in spring from the passes of the Apennines, or to that suddentransition from the cool gloom of our houses to the dazzling brightnessof our summer sun, by which the <em>lippi</em> are said to have been made sonumerous among the ancient Romans; or, in fine, to some occult causewhich eludes our superficial surmises. But I pray you be seated: Nello,my friend, be seated.”</p><p>Bardo paused until his fine ear had assured him that the visitors wereseating themselves, and that Romola was taking her usual chair at hisright-hand. Then he said—</p><p>“From what part of Greece do you come, Messere? I had thought that yourunhappy country had been almost exhausted of those sons who couldcherish in their minds any image of her original glory, though indeedthe barbarous Sultans have of late shown themselves not indisposed toengraft on their wild stock the precious vine which their own fiercebands have hewn down and trampled under foot. From what part of Greecedo you come?”</p><p>“I sailed last from Nauplia,” said Tito; “but I have resided both atConstantinople and Thessalonica, and have travelled in various partslittle visited by Western Christians since the triumph of the Turkisharms. I should tell you, however, Messere, that I was not born inGreece, but at Bari. I spent the first sixteen years of my life inSouthern Italy and Sicily.”</p><p>While Tito was speaking, some emotion passed, like a breath on thewaters, across Bardo’s delicate features; he leaned forward, put outhis right-hand towards Romola, and turned his head as if about to speakto her; but then, correcting himself, turned away again, and said, in asubdued voice—</p><p>“Excuse me; is it not true—you are young?”</p><p>“I am three-and-twenty,” said Tito.</p><p>“Ah,” said Bardo, still in a tone of subdued excitement, “and you had,doubtless, a father who cared for your early instruction—who, perhaps,was himself a scholar?”</p><p>There was a slight pause before Tito’s answer came to the ear of Bardo;but for Romola and Nello it began with a slight shock that seemed topass through him, and cause a momentary quivering of the lip; doubtlessat the revival of a supremely painful remembrance.</p><p>“Yes,” he replied, “at least a father by adoption. He was a Neapolitan,and of accomplished scholarship, both Latin and Greek. But,” addedTito, after another slight pause, “he is lost to me—was lost on avoyage he too rashly undertook to Delos.”</p><p>Bardo sank backward again, too delicate to ask another question thatmight probe a sorrow which he divined to be recent. Romola, who knewwell what were the fibres that Tito’s voice had stirred in her father,felt that this new acquaintance had with wonderful suddenness gotwithin the barrier that lay between them and the alien world. Nello,thinking that the evident check given to the conversation offered agraceful opportunity for relieving himself from silence, said—</p><p>“In truth, it is as clear as Venetian glass that this fine young manhas had the best training; for the two Cennini have set him to work attheir Greek sheets already, and it seems to me they are not men tobegin cutting before they have felt the edge of their tools; theytested him well beforehand, we may be sure, and if there are two thingsnot to be hidden—love and a cough—I say there is a third, and that isignorance, when once a man is obliged to do something besides wagginghis head. The <em>tonsor inequalis</em> is inevitably betrayed when he takesthe shears in his hand; is it not true, Messer Bardo? I speak after thefashion of a barber, but, as Luigi Pulci says—</p><p>“‘Perdonimi s’io fallo: chi m’ascoltaIntenda il mio volgar col suo latino.’”</p><p>“Nay, my good Nello,” said Bardo, with an air of friendly severity,“you are not altogether illiterate, and might doubtless have made amore respectable progress in learning if you had abstained somewhatfrom the <em>cicalata</em> and gossip of the street-corner, to which ourFlorentines are excessively addicted; but still more if you had notclogged your memory with those frivolous productions of which LuigiPulci has furnished the most peccant exemplar—a compendium ofextravagances and incongruities the farthest removed from the models ofa pure age, and resembling rather the <em>grylli</em> or conceits of a periodwhen mystic meaning was held a warrant for monstrosity of form; withthis difference, that while the monstrosity is retained, the mysticmeaning is absent; in contemptible contrast with the great poem ofVirgil, who, as I long held with Filelfo, before Landino had taken uponhim to expound the same opinion, embodied the deepest lessons ofphilosophy in a graceful and well-knit fable. And I cannot but regardthe multiplication of these babbling, lawless productions, albeitcountenanced by the patronage, and in some degree the example ofLorenzo himself, otherwise a friend to true learning, as a sign thatthe glorious hopes of this century are to be quenched in gloom; nay,that they have been the delusive prologue to an age worse than that ofiron—the age of tinsel and gossamer, in which no thought has substanceenough to be moulded into consistent and lasting form.”</p><p>“Once more, pardon,” said Nello, opening his palms outwards, andshrugging his shoulders, “I find myself knowing so many things in goodTuscan before I have time to think of the Latin for them; and MesserLuigi’s rhymes are always slipping off the lips of my customers:—thatis what corrupts me. And, indeed, talking of customers, I have left myshop and my reputation too long in the custody of my slow Sandro, whodoes not deserve even to be called a <em>tonsor inequalis</em>, but rather tobe pronounced simply a bungler in the vulgar tongue. So with yourpermission, Messer Bardo, I will take my leave—well understood that Iam at your service whenever Maso calls upon me. It seems a thousandyears till I dress and perfume the damigella’s hair, which deserves toshine in the heavens as a constellation, though indeed it were a pityfor it ever to go so far out of reach.”</p><p>Three voices made a fugue of friendly farewells to Nello, as heretreated with a bow to Romola and a beck to Tito. The acute barber sawthat the pretty youngster, who had crept into his liking by some strongmagic, was well launched in Bardo’s favourable regard; and satisfiedthat his introduction had not miscarried so far, he felt the proprietyof retiring.</p><p>The little burst of wrath, called forth by Nello’s unlucky quotation,had diverted Bardo’s mind from the feelings which had just before beenhemming in further speech, and he now addressed Tito again with hisordinary calmness.</p><p>“Ah! young man, you are happy in having been able to unite theadvantages of travel with those of study, and you will be welcome amongus as a bringer of fresh tidings from a land which has become sadlystrange to us, except through the agents of a now restricted commerceand the reports of hasty pilgrims. For those days are in the fardistance which I myself witnessed, when men like Aurispa and Guarinowent out to Greece as to a storehouse, and came back laden withmanuscripts which every scholar was eager to borrow—and, be it ownedwith shame, not always willing to restore; nay, even the days whenerudite Greeks flocked to our shores for a refuge, seem far-offnow—farther off than the on-coming of my blindness. But doubtless,young man, research after the treasures of antiquity was not alien tothe purpose of your travels?”</p><p>“Assuredly not,” said Tito. “On the contrary, my companion—myfather—was willing to risk his life in his zeal for the discovery ofinscriptions and other traces of ancient civilisation.”</p><p>“And I trust there is a record of his researches and their results,”said Bardo, eagerly, “since they must be even more precious than thoseof Ciriaco, which I have diligently availed myself of, though they arenot always illuminated by adequate learning.”</p><p>“There <em>was</em> such a record,” said Tito, “but it was lost, likeeverything else, in the shipwreck I suffered below Ancona. The onlyrecord left is such as remains in our—in my memory.”</p><p>“You must lose no time in committing it to paper, young man,” saidBardo, with growing interest. “Doubtless you remember much, if youaided in transcription; for when I was your age, words wroughtthemselves into my mind as if they had been fixed by the tool of thegraver; wherefore I constantly marvel at the capriciousness of mydaughter’s memory, which grasps certain objects with tenacity, and letsfall all those minutiae whereon depends accuracy, the very soul ofscholarship. But I apprehend no such danger with you, young man, ifyour will has seconded the advantages of your training.”</p><p>When Bardo made this reference to his daughter, Tito ventured to turnhis eyes towards her, and at the accusation against her memory his facebroke into its brightest smile, which was reflected as inevitably assudden sunbeams in Romola’s. Conceive the soothing delight of thatsmile to her! Romola had never dreamed that there was a scholar in theworld who would smile at a deficiency for which she was constantly madeto feel herself a culprit. It was like the dawn of a new sense toher—the sense of comradeship. They did not look away from each otherimmediately, as if the smile had been a stolen one; they looked andsmiled with frank enjoyment.</p><p>“She is not really so cold and proud,” thought Tito.</p><p>“Does <em>he</em> forget too, I wonder?” thought Romola, “Yet I hope not, elsehe will vex my father.”</p><p>But Tito was obliged to turn away, and answer Bardo’s question.</p><p>“I have had much practice in transcription,” he said; “but in the caseof inscriptions copied in memorable scenes, rendered doubly impressiveby the sense of risk and adventure, it may have happened that myretention of written characters has been weakened. On the plain of theEurotas, or among the gigantic stones of Mycenae and Tyrins—especiallywhen the fear of the Turk hovers over one like a vulture—the mindwanders, even though the hand writes faithfully what the eye dictates.But something doubtless I have retained,” added Tito, with a modestywhich was not false, though he was conscious that it was politic,“something that might be of service if illustrated and corrected by awider learning than my own.”</p><p>“That is well spoken, young man,” said Bardo, delighted. “And I willnot withhold from you such aid as I can give, if you like tocommunicate with me concerning your recollections. I foresee a workwhich will be a useful supplement to the ‘Isolario’ of ChristoforoBuondelmonte, and which may take rank with the ‘Itineraria’ of Ciriacoand the admirable Ambrogio Traversari. But we must prepare ourselvesfor calumny, young man,” Bardo went on with energy, as if the work werealready growing so fast that the time of trial was near; “if your bookcontains novelties you will be charged with forgery; if my elucidationsshould clash with any principles of interpretation adopted by anotherscholar, our personal characters will be attacked, we shall beimpeached with foul actions; you must prepare yourself to be told thatyour mother was a fish-woman, and that your father was a renegadepriest or a hanged malefactor. I myself, for having shown error in asingle preposition, had an invective written against me wherein I wastaxed with treachery, fraud, indecency, and even hideous crimes. Such,my young friend—such are the flowers with which the glorious path ofscholarship is strewed! But tell me, then: I have learned muchconcerning Byzantium and Thessalonica long ago from DemetrioCalcondila, who has but lately departed from Florence; but you, itseems, have visited less familiar scenes?”</p><p>“Yes; we made what I may call a pilgrimage full of danger, for the sakeof visiting places which have almost died out of the memory of theWest, for they lie away from the track of pilgrims; and my father usedto say that scholars themselves hardly imagine them to have anyexistence out of books. He was of opinion that a new and more gloriousera would open for learning when men should begin to look for theircommentaries on the ancient writers in the remains of cities andtemples, nay, in the paths of the rivers, and on the face of thevalleys and the mountains.”</p><p>“Ah!” said Bardo, fervidly, “your father, then, was not a common man.Was he fortunate, may I ask? Had he many friends?” These last wordswere uttered in a tone charged with meaning.</p><p>“No; he made enemies—chiefly, I believe, by a certain impetuouscandour; and they hindered his advancement, so that he lived inobscurity. And he would never stoop to conciliate: he could neverforget an injury.”</p><p>“Ah!” said Bardo again, with a long, deep intonation.</p><p>“Among our hazardous expeditions,” continued Tito, willing to preventfurther questions on a point so personal, “I remember with particularvividness a hastily snatched visit to Athens. Our hurry, and the doubledanger of being seized as prisoners by the Turks, and of our galleyraising anchor before we could return, made it seem like a feveredvision of the night—the wide plain, the girdling mountains, the ruinedporticos and columns, either standing far aloof, as if receding fromour hurried footsteps, or else jammed in confusedly among the dwellingsof Christians degraded into servitude, or among the forts and turretsof their Moslem conquerors, who have their stronghold on theAcropolis.”</p><p>“You fill me with surprise,” said Bardo. “Athens, then, is not utterlydestroyed and swept away, as I had imagined?”</p><p>“No wonder you should be under that mistake, for few even of the Greeksthemselves, who live beyond the mountain boundary of Attica, knowanything about the present condition of Athens, or <em>Setine</em>, as thesailors call it. I remember, as we were rounding the promontory ofSunium, the Greek pilot we had on board our Venetian galley pointed tothe mighty columns that stand on the summit of the rock—the remains, asyou know well, of the great temple erected to the goddess Athena, wholooked down from that high shrine with triumph at her conquered rivalPoseidon;—well, our Greek pilot, pointing to those columns, said, ‘Thatwas the school of the great philosopher Aristotle.’ And at Athensitself, the monk who acted as our guide in the hasty view we snatched,insisted most on showing us the spot where Saint Philip baptised theEthiopian eunuch, or some such legend.”</p><p>“Talk not of monks and their legends, young man!” said Bardo,interrupting Tito impetuously. “It is enough to overlay human hope andenterprise with an eternal frost to think that the ground which wastrodden by philosophers and poets is crawled over by thoseinsect-swarms of besotted fanatics or howling hypocrites.”</p><p>“<em>Perdio</em>, I have no affection for them,” said Tito, with a shrug;“servitude agrees well with a religion like theirs, which lies in therenunciation of all that makes life precious to other men. And theycarry the yoke that befits them: their matin chant is drowned by thevoice of the muezzin, who, from the gallery of the high tower on theAcropolis, calls every Mussulman to his prayers. That tower springsfrom the Parthenon itself; and every time we paused and directed oureyes towards it, our guide set up a wail, that a temple which had oncebeen won from the diabolical uses of the pagans to become the temple ofanother virgin than Pallas—the Virgin Mother of God—was now againperverted to the accursed ends of the Moslem. It was the sight of thosewalls of the Acropolis, which disclosed themselves in the distance aswe leaned over the side of our galley when it was forced by contrarywinds to anchor in the Piraeus, that fired my father’s mind with thedetermination to see Athens at all risks, and in spite of the sailors’warnings that if we lingered till a change of wind, they would departwithout us: but, after all, it was impossible for us to venture nearthe Acropolis, for the sight of men eager in examining ‘old stones’raised the suspicion that we were Venetian spies, and we had to hurryback to the harbour.”</p><p>“We will talk more of these things,” said Bardo, eagerly. “You mustrecall everything, to the minutest trace left in your memory. You willwin the gratitude of after-times by leaving a record of the aspectGreece bore while yet the barbarians had not swept away every trace ofthe structures that Pausanias and Pliny described: you will take thosegreat writers as your models; and such contribution of criticism andsuggestion as my riper mind can supply shall not be wanting to you.There will be much to tell; for you have travelled, you said, in thePeloponnesus?”</p><p>“Yes; and in Boeotia also: I have rested in the groves of Helicon, andtasted of the fountain Hippocrene. But on every memorable spot inGreece conquest after conquest has set its seal, till there is aconfusion of ownership even in ruins, that only close study andcomparison could unravel. High over every fastness, from the plains ofLacedaemon to the straits of Thermopylae, there towers some hugeFrankish fortress, once inhabited by a French or Italian marquis, noweither abandoned or held by Turkish bands.”</p><p>“Stay!” cried Bardo, whose mind was now too thoroughly preoccupied bythe idea of the future book to attend to Tito’s further narration. “Doyou think of writing in Latin or Greek? Doubtless Greek is the moreready clothing for your thoughts, and it is the nobler language. But,on the other hand, Latin is the tongue in which we shall measureourselves with the larger and more famous number of modern rivals. Andif you are less at ease in it, I will aid you—yes, I will spend on youthat long-accumulated study which was to have been thrown into thechannel of another work—a work in which I myself was to have had ahelpmate.”</p><p>Bardo paused a moment, and then added—</p><p>“But who knows whether that work may not be executed yet? For you, too,young man, have been brought up by a father who poured into your mindall the long-gathered stream of his knowledge and experience. Our aidmight be mutual.”</p><p>Romola, who had watched her father’s growing excitement, and divinedwell the invisible currents of feeling that determined every questionand remark, felt herself in a glow of strange anxiety: she turned hereyes on Tito continually, to watch the impression her father’s wordsmade on him, afraid lest he should be inclined to dispel these visionsof co-operation which were lighting up her father’s face with a newhope. But no! He looked so bright and gentle: he must feel, as she did,that in this eagerness of blind age there was piteousness enough tocall forth inexhaustible patience. How much more strongly he would feelthis if he knew about her brother! A girl of eighteen imagines thefeelings behind the face that has moved her with its sympathetic youth,as easily as primitive people imagined the humours of the gods in fairweather: what is she to believe in, if not in this vision woven fromwithin?</p><p>And Tito was really very far from feeling impatient. He delighted insitting there with the sense that Romola’s attention was fixed on him,and that he could occasionally look at her. He was pleased that Bardoshould take an interest in him; and he did not dwell with enoughseriousness on the prospect of the work in which he was to be aided, tofeel moved by it to anything else than that easy, good-humouredacquiescence which was natural to him.</p><p>“I shall be proud and happy,” he said, in answer to Bardo’s last words,“if my services can be held a meet offering to the matured scholarshipof Messere. But doubtless,”—here he looked towards Romola—“the lovelydamigella, your daughter, makes all other aid superfluous; for I havelearned from Nello that she has been nourished on the highest studiesfrom her earliest years.”</p><p>“You are mistaken,” said Romola; “I am by no means sufficient to myfather: I have not the gifts that are necessary for scholarship.”</p><p>Romola did not make this self-depreciatory statement in a tone ofanxious humility, but with a proud gravity.</p><p>“Nay, my Romola,” said her father, not willing that the stranger shouldhave too low a conception of his daughter’s powers; “thou art notdestitute of gifts; rather, thou art endowed beyond the measure ofwomen; but thou hast withal the woman’s delicate frame, which evercraves repose and variety, and so begets a wandering imagination. Mydaughter,”—turning to Tito—“has been very precious to me, filling up tothe best of her power the place of a son. For I had once a son...”</p><p>Bardo checked himself: he did not wish to assume an attitude ofcomplaint in the presence of a stranger, and he remembered that thisyoung man, in whom he had unexpectedly become so much interested, wasstill a stranger, towards whom it became him rather to keep theposition of a patron. His pride was roused to double activity by thefear that he had forgotten his dignity.</p><p>“But,” he resumed, in his original tone of condescension, “we aredeparting from what I believe is to you the most important business.Nello informed me that you had certain gems which you would faindispose of, and that you desired a passport to some man of wealth andtaste who would be likely to become a purchaser.”</p><p>“It is true; for, though I have obtained employment, as a correctorwith the Cennini, my payment leaves little margin beyond the provisionof necessaries, and would leave less but that my good friend Nelloinsists on my hiring a lodging from him, and saying nothing about therent till better days.”</p><p>“Nello is a good-hearted prodigal,” said Bardo; “and though, with thatready ear and ready tongue of his, he is too much like the ill-famedMargites—knowing many things and knowing them all badly, as I hinted tohim but now—he is nevertheless ‘abnormis sapiens,’ after the manner ofour born Florentines. But have you the gems with you? I would willinglyknow what they are—yet it is useless: no, it might only deepen regret.I cannot add to my store.”</p><p>“I have one or two intaglios of much beauty,” said Tito, proceeding todraw from his wallet a small case.</p><p>But Romola no sooner saw the movement than she looked at him withsignificant gravity, and placed her finger on her lips—</p><p>“Con viso che tacendo dicea, Taci.”</p><p>If Bardo were made aware that the gems were within reach, she knew wellhe would want a minute description of them, and it would become pain tohim that they should go away from him, even if he did not insist onsome device for purchasing them in spite of poverty. But she had nosooner made this sign than she felt rather guilty and ashamed at havingvirtually confessed a weakness of her father’s to a stranger. It seemedthat she was destined to a sudden confidence and familiarity with thisyoung Greek, strangely at variance with her deep-seated pride andreserve; and this consciousness again brought the unwonted colour toher cheeks.</p><p>Tito understood her look and sign, and immediately withdrew his handfrom the case, saying, in a careless tone, so as to make it appear thathe was merely following up his last words, “But they are usually in thekeeping of Messer Domenico Cennini, who has strong and safe places forthese things. He estimates them as worth at least five hundred ducats.”</p><p>“Ah, then, they are fine intagli,” said Bardo. “Five hundred ducats!Ah, more than a man’s ransom!”</p><p>Tito gave a slight, almost imperceptible start, and opened his longdark eyes with questioning surprise at Bardo’s blind face, as if hiswords—a mere phrase of common parlance, at a time when men were oftenbeing ransomed from slavery or imprisonment—had had some specialmeaning for him. But the next moment he looked towards Romola, as ifher eyes must be her father’s interpreters. She, intensely preoccupiedwith what related to her father, imagined that Tito was looking to heragain for some guidance, and immediately spoke.</p><p>“Alessandra Scala delights in gems, you know, father; she calls themher winter flowers; and the Segretario would be almost sure to buy anygems that she wished for. Besides, he himself sets great store by ringsand sigils, which he wears as a defence against pains in the joints.”</p><p>“It is true,” said Bardo. “Bartolommeo has overmuch confidence in theefficacy of gems—a confidence wider than what is sanctioned by Pliny,who clearly shows that he regards many beliefs of that sort as idlesuperstitions; though not to the utter denial of medicinal virtues ingems. Wherefore, I myself, as you observe, young man, wear certainrings, which the discreet Camillo Leonardi prescribed to me by letterwhen two years ago I had a certain infirmity of sudden numbness. Butthou hast spoken well, Romola. I will dictate a letter to Bartolommeo,which Maso shall carry. But it were well that Messere should notify tothee what the gems are, together with the intagli they bear, as awarrant to Bartolommeo that they will be worthy of his attention.”</p><p>“Nay, father,” said Romola, whose dread lest a paroxysm of thecollector’s mania should seize her father, gave her the courage toresist his proposal. “Your word will be sufficient that Messere is ascholar and has travelled much. The Segretario will need no furtherinducement to receive him.”</p><p>“True, child,” said Bardo, touched on a chord that was sure to respond.“I have no need to add proofs and arguments in confirmation of my wordto Bartolommeo. And I doubt not that this young man’s presence is inaccord with the tones of his voice, so that, the door being onceopened, he will be his own best advocate.”</p><p>Bardo paused a few moments, but his silence was evidently charged withsome idea that he was hesitating to express, for he once leaned forwarda little as if he were going to speak, then turned his head asidetowards Romola and sank backward again. At last, as if he had made uphis mind, he said in a tone which might have become a prince giving thecourteous signal of dismissal—</p><p>“I am somewhat fatigued this morning, and shall prefer seeing you againto-morrow, when I shall be able to give you the secretary’s answer,authorising you to present yourself to him at some given time. Butbefore you go,”—here the old man, in spite of himself, fell into a morefaltering tone—“you will perhaps permit me to touch your hand? It islong since I touched the hand of a young man.”</p><p>Bardo had stretched out his aged white hand, and Tito immediatelyplaced his dark but delicate and supple fingers within it. Bardo’scramped fingers closed over them, and he held them for a few minutes insilence. Then he said—</p><p>“Romola, has this young man the same complexion as thy brother—fair andpale?”</p><p>“No, father,” Romola answered, with determined composure, though herheart began to beat violently with mingled emotions. “The hair ofMessere is dark—his complexion is dark.” Inwardly she said, “Will hemind it? will it be disagreeable? No, he looks so gentle andgood-natured.” Then aloud again—</p><p>“Would Messere permit my father to touch his hair and face?”</p><p>Her eyes inevitably made a timid entreating appeal while she askedthis, and Tito’s met them with soft brightness as he said, “Assuredly,”and, leaning forward, raised Bardo’s hand to his curls, with areadiness of assent, which was the greater relief to her, because itwas unaccompanied by any sign of embarrassment.</p><p>Bardo passed his hand again and again over the long curls and graspedthem a little, as if their spiral resistance made his inward visionclearer; then he passed his hand over the brow and cheek, tracing theprofile with the edge of his palm and fourth finger, and letting thebreadth of his hand repose on the rich oval of the cheek.</p><p>“Ah,” he said, as his hand glided from the face and rested on the youngman’s shoulder. “He must be very unlike thy brother, Romola: and it isthe better. You see no visions, I trust, my young friend?”</p><p>At this moment the door opened, and there entered, unannounced, a tallelderly man in a handsome black silk lucco, who, unwinding hisbecchetto from his neck and taking off his cap, disclosed a head aswhite as Bardo’s. He cast a keen glance of surprise at the group beforehim—the young stranger leaning in that filial attitude, while Bardo’shand rested on his shoulder, and Romola sitting near with eyes dilatedby anxiety and agitation. But there was an instantaneous change: Bardolet fall his hand, Tito raised himself from his stooping posture, andRomola rose to meet the visitor with an alacrity which implied all thegreater intimacy, because it was unaccompanied by any smile.</p><p>“Well, god-daughter,” said the stately man, as he touched Romola’sshoulder; “Maso said you had a visitor, but I came in nevertheless.”</p><p>“It is thou, Bernardo,” said Bardo. “Thou art come at a fortunatemoment. This, young man,” he continued, while Tito rose and bowed, “isone of the chief citizens of Florence, Messer Bernardo del Nero, myoldest, I had almost said my only friend—whose good opinion, if you canwin it, may carry you far. He is but three-and-twenty, Bernardo, yet hecan doubtless tell thee much which thou wilt care to hear; for though ascholar, he has already travelled far, and looked on other thingsbesides the manuscripts for which thou hast too light an esteem.”</p><p>“Ah, a Greek, as I augur,” said Bernardo, returning Tito’s reverencebut slightly, and surveying him with that sort of glance which seemsalmost to cut like fine steel. “Newly arrived in Florence, it appears.The name of Messere—or part of it, for it is doubtless a long one?”</p><p>“On the contrary,” said Tito, with perfect good-humour, “it is mostmodestly free from polysyllabic pomp. My name is Tito Melema.”</p><p>“Truly?” said Bernardo, rather scornfully, as he took a seat; “I hadexpected it to be at least as long as the names of a city, a river, aprovince, and an empire all put together. We Florentines mostly usenames as we do prawns, and strip them of all flourishes before we trustthem to our throats.”</p><p>“Well, Bardo,” he continued, as if the stranger were not worth furthernotice, and changing his tone of sarcastic suspicion for one ofsadness, “we have buried him.”</p><p>“Ah!” replied Bardo, with corresponding sadness, “and a new epoch hascome for Florence—a dark one, I fear. Lorenzo has left behind him aninheritance that is but like the alchemist’s laboratory when the wisdomof the alchemist is gone.”</p><p>“Not altogether so,” said Bernardo. “Piero de’ Medici has abundantintelligence; his faults are only the faults of hot blood. I love thelad—lad he will always be to me, as I have always been ‘little father’to him.”</p><p>“Yet all who want a new order of things are likely to conceive newhopes,” said Bardo. “We shall have the old strife of parties, I fear.”</p><p>“If we could have a new order of things that was something else thanknocking down one coat of arms to put up another,” said Bernardo, “Ishould be ready to say, ‘I belong to no party: I am a Florentine.’ Butas long as parties are in question, I am a Medicean, and will be aMedicean till I die. I am of the same mind as Farinata degli Uberti: ifany man asks me what is meant by siding with a party, I say, as he did,‘To wish ill or well, for the sake of past wrongs or kindnesses.’”</p><p>During this short dialogue, Tito had been standing, and now took hisleave.</p><p>“But come again at the same hour to-morrow,” said Bardo, graciously,before Tito left the room, “that I may give you Bartolommeo’s answer.”</p><p>“From what quarter of the sky has this pretty Greek youngster alightedso close to thy chair, Bardo?” said Bernardo del Nero, as the doorclosed. He spoke with dry emphasis, evidently intended to conveysomething more to Bardo than was implied by the mere words.</p><p>“He is a scholar who has been shipwrecked and has saved a few gems, forwhich he wants to find a purchaser. I am going to send him toBartolommeo Scala, for thou knowest it were more prudent in me toabstain from further purchases.”</p><p>Bernardo shrugged his shoulders and said, “Romola, wilt thou see if myservant is without? I ordered him to wait for me here.” Then, whenRomola was at a sufficient distance, he leaned forward and said toBardo in a low, emphatic tone—</p><p>“Remember, Bardo, thou hast a rare gem of thy own; take care no onegets it who is not likely to pay a worthy price. That pretty Greek hasa lithe sleekness about him, that seems marvellously fitted forslipping easily into any nest he fixes his mind on.”</p><p>Bardo was startled: the association of Tito with the image of his lostson had excluded instead of suggesting the thought of Romola. Butalmost immediately there seemed to be a reaction which made him graspthe warning as if it had been a hope.</p><p>“But why not, Bernardo? If the young man approved himself worthy—he isa scholar—and—and there would be no difficulty about the dowry, whichalways makes thee gloomy.”</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/CYux/GEreader/tree/main/docs/romola/BOOK I/6_CHAPTER_VI.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/GEreader/romola/BOOK I/CHAPTER_V"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">V.
