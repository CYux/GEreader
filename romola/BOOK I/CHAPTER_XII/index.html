Yet Romola’s life seemedan image of that loving, pitying devotedness, that patient endurance ofirksome tasks, from which he had shrunk and excused himself. But he wasnot out of love with goodness, or prepared to plunge into vice: he wasin his fresh youth, with soft pulses for all charm and loveliness; hehad still a healthy appetite for ordinary human joys, and the poisoncould only work by degrees. He had sold himself to evil, but at presentlife seemed so nearly the same to him that he was not conscious of thebond. He meant all things to go on as they had done before, both withinand without him: he meant to win golden opinions by meritoriousexertion, by ingenious learning, by amiable compliance: he was notgoing to do anything that would throw him out of harmony with thebeings he cared for. And he cared supremely for Romola; he wished tohave her for his beautiful and loving wife. There might be a wealthieralliance within the ultimate reach of successful accomplishments likehis, but there was no woman in all Florence like Romola. When she wasnear him, and looked at him with her sincere hazel eyes, he was subduedby a delicious influence as strong and inevitable as those musicalvibrations which take possession of us with a rhythmic empire that nosooner ceases than we desire it to begin again.</p><p>As he trod the stone stairs, when he was still outside the door, withno one but Maso near him, the influence seemed to have begun its workby the mere nearness of anticipation.</p><p>“Welcome, Tito mio,” said the old man’s voice, before Tito had spoken.There was a new vigour in the voice, a new cheerfulness in the blindface, since that first interview more than two months ago. “You havebrought fresh manuscript, doubtless; but since we were talking lastnight I have had new ideas: we must take a wider scope—we must go backupon our footsteps.”</p><p>Tito, paying his homage to Romola as he advanced, went, as his customwas, straight to Bardo’s chair, and put his hand in the palm that washeld to receive it, placing himself on the cross-legged leather seatwith scrolled ends, close to Bardo’s elbow.</p><p>“Yes,” he said, in his gentle way; “I have brought the new manuscript,but that can wait your pleasure. I have young limbs, you know, and canwalk back up the hill without any difficulty.”</p><p>He did not look at Romola as he said this, but he knew quite well thather eyes were fixed on him with delight.</p><p>“That is well said, my son.” Bardo had already addressed Tito in thisway once or twice of late. “And I perceive with gladness that you donot shrink from labour, without which, the poet has wisely said, lifehas given nothing to mortals. It is too often the ‘palma sine pulvere,’the prize of glory without the dust of the race, that attracts youngambition. But what says the Greek? ‘In the morning of life, work; inthe mid-day, give counsel; in the evening, pray.’ It is true, I mightbe thought to have reached that helpless evening; but not so, while Ihave counsel within me which is yet unspoken. For my mind, as I haveoften said, was shut up as by a dam; the plenteous waters lay dark andmotionless; but you, my Tito, have opened a duct for them, and theyrush forward with a force that surprises myself. And now, what I wantis, that we should go over our preliminary ground again, with a widerscheme of comment and illustration: otherwise I may lose opportunitieswhich I now see retrospectively, and which may never occur again. Youmark what I am saying, Tito?”</p><p>He had just stooped to reach his manuscript, which had rolled down, andBardo’s jealous ear was alive to the slight movement.</p><p>Tito might have been excused for shrugging his shoulders at theprospect before him, but he was not naturally impatient; moreover, hehad been bred up in that laborious erudition, at once minute andcopious, which was the chief intellectual task of the age; and withRomola near, he was floated along by waves of agreeable sensation thatmade everything seem easy.</p><p>“Assuredly,” he said; “you wish to enlarge your comments on certainpassages we have cited.”</p><p>“Not only so; I wish to introduce an occasional <em>excursus</em>, where wehave noticed an author to whom I have given special study; for I maydie too soon to achieve any separate work. And this is not a time forscholarly integrity and well-sifted learning to lie idle, when it isnot only rash ignorance that we have to fear, but when there are menlike Calderino, who, as Poliziano has well shown, have recourse toimpudent falsities of citation to serve the ends of their vanity andsecure a triumph to their own mistakes. Wherefore, my Tito, I think itnot well that we should let slip the occasion that lies under ourhands. And now we will turn back to the point where we have cited thepassage from Thucydides, and I wish you, by way of preliminary, to gowith me through all my notes on the Latin translation made by LorenzoValla, for which the incomparable Pope Nicholas the Fifth—with whosepersonal notice I was honoured while I was yet young, and when he wasstill Thomas of Sarzana—paid him (I say not unduly) the sum of fivehundred gold scudi. But inasmuch as Valla, though otherwise of dubiousfame, is held in high honour for his severe scholarship, whence theepigrammatist has jocosely said of him that since he went among theshades, Pluto himself has not dared to speak in the ancient languages,it is the more needful that his name should not be as a stampwarranting false wares; and therefore I would introduce an _excursus_on Thucydides, wherein my castigations of Valla’s text may find afitting place. My Romola, thou wilt reach the needful volumes—thouknowest them—on the fifth shelf of the cabinet.”</p><p>Tito rose at the same moment with Romola, saying, “I will reach them,if you will point them out,” and followed her hastily into theadjoining small room, where the walls were also covered with ranges ofbooks in perfect order.</p><p>“There they are,” said Romola, pointing upward; “every book is justwhere it was when my father ceased to see them.”</p><p>Tito stood by her without hastening to reach the books. They had neverbeen in this room together before.</p><p>“I hope,” she continued, turning her eyes full on Tito, with a look ofgrave confidence—“I hope he will not weary you; this work makes him sohappy.”</p><p>“And me too, Romola—if you will only let me say, I love you—if you willonly think me worth loving a little.”</p><p>His speech was the softest murmur, and the dark beautiful face, nearerto hers than it had ever been before, was looking at her withbeseeching tenderness.</p><p>“I do love you,” murmured Romola; she looked at him with the samesimple majesty as ever, but her voice had never in her life before sunkto that murmur. It seemed to them both that they were looking at eachother a long while before her lips moved again; yet it was but a momenttill she said, “I know <em>now</em> what it is to be happy.”</p><p>The faces just met, and the dark curls mingled for an instant with therippling gold. Quick as lightning after that, Tito set his foot on aprojecting ledge of the book-shelves and reached down the needfulvolumes. They were both contented to be silent and separate, for thatfirst blissful experience of mutual consciousness was all the moreexquisite for being unperturbed by immediate sensation.</p><p>It had all been as rapid as the irreversible mingling of waters, foreven the eager and jealous Bardo had not become impatient.</p><p>“You have the volumes, my Romola?” the old man said, as they came nearhim again. “And now you will get your pen ready; for, as Tito marks offthe scholia we determine on extracting, it will be well for you to copythem without delay—numbering them carefully, mind, to correspond withthe numbers in the text which he will write.”</p><p>Romola always had some task which gave her a share in this joint work.Tito took his stand at the leggio, where he both wrote and read, andshe placed herself at a table just in front of him, where she was readyto give into her father’s hands anything that he might happen to want,or relieve him of a volume that he had done with. They had always beenin that position since the work began, yet on this day it seemed new;it was so different now for them to be opposite each other; sodifferent for Tito to take a book from her, as she lifted it from herfather’s knee. Yet there was no finesse to secure an additional look ortouch. Each woman creates in her own likeness the love-tokens that areoffered to her; and Romola’s deep calm happiness encompassed Tito likethe rich but quiet evening light which dissipates all unrest.</p><p>They had been two hours at their work, and were just desisting becauseof the fading light, when the door opened and there entered a figurestrangely incongruous with the current of their thoughts and with thesuggestions of every object around them. It was the figure of a shortstout black-eyed woman, about fifty, wearing a black velvet berretta,or close cap, embroidered with pearls, under which surprisingly massiveblack braids surmounted the little bulging forehead, and fell in richplaited curves over the ears, while an equally surprising carmine tinton the upper region of the fat cheeks contrasted with the surroundingsallowness. Three rows of pearls and a lower necklace of gold reposedon the horizontal cushion of her neck; the embroidered border of hertrailing black velvet gown and her embroidered long-drooping sleeves ofrose-coloured damask, were slightly faded, but they conveyed to theinitiated eye the satisfactory assurance that they were the splendidresult of six months’ labour by a skilled workman; and therose-coloured petticoat, with its dimmed white fringe and seed-pearlarabesques, was duly exhibited in order to suggest a similar pleasingreflection. A handsome coral rosary hung from one side of aninferential belt, which emerged into certainty with a large clasp ofsilver wrought in niello; and, on the other side, where the belt againbecame inferential, hung a scarsella, or large purse, of crimsonvelvet, stitched with pearls. Her little fat right-hand, which lookedas if it had been made of paste, and had risen out of shape underpartial baking, held a small book of devotions, also splendid withvelvet, pearls, and silver.</p><p>The figure was already too familiar to Tito to be startling, for MonnaBrigida was a frequent visitor at Bardo’s, being excepted from thesentence of banishment passed on feminine triviality, on the ground ofher cousinship to his dead wife and her early care for Romola, who nowlooked round at her with an affectionate smile, and rose to draw theleather seat to a due distance from her father’s chair, that the cominggush of talk might not be too near his ear.</p><p>“<em>La cugina</em>?” said Bardo, interrogatively, detecting the short stepsand the sweeping drapery.</p><p>“Yes, it is your cousin,” said Monna Brigida, in an alert voice,raising her fingers smilingly at Tito, and then lifting up her face tobe kissed by Romola. “Always the troublesome cousin breaking in on yourwisdom,” she went on, seating herself and beginning to fan herself withthe white veil hanging over her arm. “Well, well; if I didn’t bring yousome news of the world now and then, I do believe you’d forget therewas anything in life but these mouldy ancients, who want sprinklingwith holy water if all I hear about them is true. Not but what theworld is bad enough nowadays, for the scandals that turn up under one’snose at every corner—<em>I</em> don’t want to hear and see such things, butone can’t go about with one’s head in a bag; and it was onlyyesterday—well, well, you needn’t burst out at me, Bardo, I’m not goingto tell anything; if I’m not as wise as the three kings, I know howmany legs go into one boot. But, nevertheless, Florence is a wickedcity—is it not true, Messer Tito? for you go into the world. Not butwhat one must sin a little—Messer Domeneddio expects that of us, elsewhat are the blessed sacraments for? And what I say is, we’ve got toreverence the saints, and not to set ourselves up as if we could belike them, else life would be unbearable; as it will be if things go onafter this new fashion. For what do you think? I’ve been at the weddingto-day—Dianora Acciajoli’s with the young Albizzi that there has beenso much talk of—and everybody wondered at its being to-day instead ofyesterday; but, <em>cieli</em>! such a wedding as it was might have been putoff till the next Quaresima for a penance. For there was the bridelooking like a white nun—not so much as a pearl about her—and thebridegroom as solemn as San Giuseppe. It’s true! And half the peopleinvited were <em>Piagnoni</em>—they call them <em>Piagnoni</em> (funeral mourners:properly, paid mourners) now, these new saints of Fra Girolamo’smaking. And to think of two families like the Albizzi and the Acciajolitaking up such notions, when they could afford to wear the best! Well,well, they invited me—but they could do no other, seeing my husband wasLuca Antonio’s uncle by the mother’s side—and a pretty time I had of itwhile we waited under the canopy in front of the house, before they letus in. I couldn’t stand in my clothes, it seemed, without givingoffence; for there was Monna Berta, who has had worse secrets in hertime than any I could tell of myself, looking askance at me from underher hood like a <em>pinzochera</em>, (a Sister of the Third Order of SaintFrancis: an uncloistered nun) and telling me to read the Frate’s bookabout widows, from which she had found great guidance. Holy Madonna! itseems as if widows had nothing to do now but to buy their coffins, andthink it a thousand years till they get into them, instead of enjoyingthemselves a little when they’ve got their hands free for the firsttime. And what do you think was the music we had, to make our dinnerlively? A long discourse from Fra Domenico of San Marco, about thedoctrines of their blessed Fra Girolamo—the three doctrines we are allto get by heart; and he kept marking them off on his fingers till hemade my flesh creep: and the first is, Florence, or the Church—I don’tknow which, for first he said one and then the other—shall be scourged;but if he means the pestilence, the Signory ought to put a stop to suchpreaching, for it’s enough to raise the swelling under one’s arms withfright: but then, after that, he says Florence is to be regenerated;but what will be the good of that when we’re all dead of the plague, orsomething else? And then, the third thing, and what he said oftenest,is, that it’s all to be in our days: and he marked that off on histhumb, till he made me tremble like the very jelly before me. They hadjellies, to be sure, with the arms of the Albizzi and the Acciajoliraised on them in all colours; they’ve not turned the world quiteupside down yet. But all their talk is, that we are to go back to theold ways: for up starts Francesco Valori, that I’ve danced with in theVia Larga when he was a bachelor and as fond of the Medici as anybody,and he makes a speech about the old times, before the Florentines hadleft off crying ‘Popolo’ and begun to cry ‘Palle’—as if that hadanything to do with a wedding!—and how we ought to keep to the rulesthe Signory laid down heaven knows when, that we were not to wear thisand that, and not to eat this and that—and how our manners werecorrupted and we read bad books; though he can’t say that of <em>me</em>—”</p><p>“Stop, cousin!” said Bardo, in his imperious tone, for he had a remarkto make, and only desperate measures could arrest the rattlinglengthiness of Monna Brigida’s discourse. But now she gave a littlestart, pursed up her mouth, and looked at him with round eyes.</p><p>“Francesco Valori is not altogether wrong,” Bardo went on. “Bernardo,indeed, rates him not highly, and is rather of opinion that hechristens private grudges by the name of public zeal; though I mustadmit that my good Bernardo is too slow of belief in that unalloyedpatriotism which was found in all its lustre amongst the ancients. Butit is true, Tito, that our manners have degenerated somewhat from thatnoble frugality which, as has been well seen in the public acts of ourcitizens, is the parent of true magnificence. For men, as I hear, willnow spend on the transient show of a Giostra sums which would sufficeto found a library, and confer a lasting possession on mankind. Still,I conceive, it remains true of us Florentines that we have more of thatmagnanimous sobriety which abhors a trivial lavishness that it may begrandly open-handed on grand occasions, than can be found in any othercity of Italy; for I understand that the Neapolitan and Milanesecourtiers laugh at the scarcity of our plate, and think scorn of ourgreat families for borrowing from each other that furniture of thetable at their entertainments. But in the vain laughter of folly wisdomhears half its applause.”</p><p>“Laughter, indeed!” burst forth Monna Brigida again, the moment, Bardopaused. “If anybody wanted to hear laughter at the wedding to-day theywere disappointed, for when young Niccolò Macchiavelli tried to make ajoke, and told stories out of Franco Sacchetti’s book, how it was nouse for the Signoria to make rules for us women, because we werecleverer than all the painters, and architects, and doctors of logic inthe world, for we could make black look white, and yellow look pink,and crooked look straight, and, if anything was forbidden, we couldfind a new name for it—Holy Virgin! the Piagnoni looked more dismalthan before, and somebody said Sacchetti’s book was wicked. Well, Idon’t read it—they can’t accuse <em>me</em> of reading anything. Save me fromgoing to a wedding again, if that’s to be the fashion; for all of uswho were not Piagnoni were as comfortable as wet chickens. I was nevercaught in a worse trap but once before, and that was when I went tohear their precious Frate last Quaresima in San Lorenzo. Perhaps Inever told you about it, Messer Tito?—it almost freezes my blood when Ithink of it. How he rated us poor women! and the men, too, to tell thetruth, but I didn’t mind that so much. He called us cows, and lumps offlesh, and wantons, and mischief-makers—and I could just bear that, forthere were plenty others more fleshy and spiteful than I was, thoughevery now and then his voice shook the very bench under me like atrumpet; but then he came to the false hair, and, O misericordia! hemade a picture—I see it now—of a young woman lying a pale corpse, andus light-minded widows—of course he meant me as well as the rest, for Ihad my plaits on, for if one is getting old, one doesn’t want to lookas ugly as the Befana,<!-- -->[1]<!-- -->—us widows rushing up to the corpse, likebare-pated vultures as we were, and cutting off its young dead hair todeck our old heads with. Oh, the dreams I had after that! And then hecried, and wrung his hands at us, and I cried too. And to go home, andto take off my jewels, this very clasp, and everything, and to makethem into a packet, <em>fù tutt’uno</em>; and I was within a hair of sendingthem to the Good Men of Saint Martin to give to the poor, but, byheaven’s mercy, I bethought me of going first to my confessor, FraCristoforo, at Santa Croce, and he told me how it was all the work ofthe devil, this preaching and prophesying of their Fra Girolamo, andthe Dominicans were trying to turn the world upside down, and I wasnever to go and hear him again, else I must do penance for it; for thegreat preachers Fra Mariano and Fra Menico had shown how Fra Girolamopreached lies—and that was true, for I heard them both in the Duomo—andhow the Pope’s dream of San Francesco propping up the Church with hisarms was being fulfilled still, and the Dominicans were beginning topull it down. Well and good: I went away <em>con Dio</em>, and made myselfeasy. I am not going to be frightened by a Frate Predicatore again. Andall I say is, I wish it hadn’t been the Dominicans that poor Dinojoined years ago, for then I should have been glad when I heard themsay he was come back—”</p><p>[1]<!-- --> The name given to the grotesque black-faced figures, supposed torepresent the Magi, carried about or placed in the windows on TwelfthNight: a corruption of Epifania.</p><p>“Silenzio!” said Bardo, in a loud agitated voice, while Romola halfstarted from her chair, clasped her hands, and looked round at Tito, asif now she might appeal to him. Monna Brigida gave a little scream, andbit her lip.</p><p>“Donna!” said Bardo, again, “hear once more my will. Bring no reportsabout that name to this house; and thou, Romola, I forbid thee to ask.My son is dead.”</p><p>Bardo’s whole frame seemed vibrating with passion, and no one dared tobreak silence again. Monna Brigida lifted her shoulders and her handsin mute dismay; then she rose as quietly as possible, gave manysignificant nods to Tito and Romola, motioning to them that they werenot to move, and stole out of the room like a culpable fat spaniel whohas barked unseasonably.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tito’s quick mind had been combining ideas withlightning-like rapidity. Bardo’s son was not really dead, then, as hehad supposed: he was a monk; he was “come back:” and Fra Luca—yes! itwas the likeness to Bardo and Romola that had made the face seemhalf-known to him. If he were only dead at Fiesole at that moment! Thisimportunate selfish wish inevitably thrust itself before every otherthought. It was true that Bardo’s rigid will was a sufficient safeguardagainst any intercourse between Romola and her brother; but _not_against the betrayal of what he knew to others, especially when thesubject was suggested by the coupling of Romola’s name with that of thevery Tito Melema whose description he had carried round his neck as anindex. No! nothing but Fra Luca’s death could remove all danger; buthis death was highly probable, and after the momentary shock of thediscovery, Tito let his mind fall back in repose on that confidenthope.</p><p>They had sat in silence, and in a deepening twilight for many minutes,when Romola ventured to say—</p><p>“Shall I light the lamp, father, and shall we go on?”</p><p>“No, my Romola, we will work no more to-night. Tito, come and sit by mehere.”</p><p>Tito moved from the reading-desk, and seated himself on the other sideof Bardo, close to his left elbow.</p><p>“Come nearer to me, figliuola mia,” said Bardo again, after a moment’spause. And Romola seated herself on a low stool and let her arm rest onher father’s right knee, that he might lay his hand on her hair, as hewas fond of doing.</p><p>“Tito, I never told you that I had once a son,” said Bardo, forgettingwhat had fallen from him in the emotion raised by their firstinterview. The old man had been deeply shaken, and was forced to pourout his feelings in spite of pride. “But he left me—he is dead to me. Ihave disowned him for ever. He was a ready scholar as you are, but morefervid and impatient, and yet sometimes rapt and self-absorbed, like aflame fed by some fitful source; showing a disposition from the veryfirst to turn away his eyes from the clear lights of reason andphilosophy, and to prostrate himself under the influences of a dimmysticism which eludes all rules of human duty as it eludes allargument. And so it ended. We will speak no more of him: he is dead tome. I wish his face could be blotted from that world of memory in whichthe distant seems to grow clearer and the near to fade.”</p><p>Bardo paused, but neither Romola nor Tito dared to speak—his voice wastoo tremulous, the poise of his feelings too doubtful. But he presentlyraised his hand and found Tito’s shoulder to rest it on, while he wenton speaking, with an effort to be calmer.</p><p>“But <em>you</em> have come to me, Tito—not quite too late. I will lose notime in vain regret. When you are working by my side I seem to havefound a son again.”</p><p>The old man, preoccupied with the governing interest of his life, wasonly thinking of the much-meditated book which had quite thrust intothe background the suggestion, raised by Bernardo del Nero’s warning,of a possible marriage between Tito and Romola. But Tito could notallow the moment to pass unused.</p><p>“Will you let me be always and altogether your son? Will you let metake care of Romola—be her husband? I think she will not deny me. Shehas said she loves me. I know I am not equal to her in birth—inanything; but I am no longer a destitute stranger.”</p><p>“Is it true, my Romola?” said Bardo, in a lower tone, an evidentvibration passing through him and dissipating the saddened aspect ofhis features.</p><p>“Yes, father,” said Romola, firmly. “I love Tito—I wish to marry him,that we may both be your children and never part.”</p><p>Tito’s hand met hers in a strong clasp for the first time, while shewas speaking, but their eyes were fixed anxiously on her father.</p><p>“Why should it not be?” said Bardo, as if arguing against anyopposition to his assent, rather than assenting. “It would be ahappiness to me; and thou, too, Romola, wouldst be the happier for it.”</p><p>He stroked her long hair gently and bent towards her.</p><p>“Ah, I have been apt to forget that thou needest some other love thanmine. And thou wilt be a noble wife. Bernardo thinks I shall hardlyfind a husband fitting for thee. And he is perhaps right. For thou artnot like the herd of thy sex: thou art such a woman as the immortalpoets had a vision of when they sang the lives of the heroes—tender butstrong, like thy voice, which has been to me instead of the light inthe years of my blindness... And so thou lovest him?”</p><p>He sat upright again for a minute, and then said, in the same tone asbefore, “Why should it not be? I will think of it; I will talk withBernardo.”</p><p>Tito felt a disagreeable chill at this answer, for Bernardo del Nero’seyes had retained their keen suspicion whenever they looked at him, andthe uneasy remembrance of Fra Luca converted all uncertainty into fear.</p><p>“Speak for me, Romola,” he said, pleadingly. “Messer Bernardo is sureto be against me.”</p><p>“No, Tito,” said Romola, “my godfather will not oppose what my fatherfirmly wills. And it is your will that I should marry Tito—is it nottrue, father? Nothing has ever come to me before that I have wished forstrongly: I did not think it possible that I could care so much foranything that could happen to myself.”</p><p>It was a brief and simple plea; but it was the condensed story ofRomola’s self-repressing colourless young life, which had thrown allits passion into sympathy with aged sorrows, aged ambition, aged prideand indignation. It had never occurred to Romola that she should notspeak as directly and emphatically of her love for Tito as of any othersubject.</p><p>“Romola mia!” said her father fondly, pausing on the words, “it is truethou hast never urged on me any wishes of thy own. And I have no willto resist thine; rather, my heart met Tito’s entreaty at its very firstutterance. Nevertheless, I must talk with Bernardo about the measuresneedful to be observed. For we must not act in haste, or do anythingunbeseeming my name. I am poor, and held of little account by thewealthy of our family—nay, I may consider myself a lonely man—but Imust nevertheless remember that generous birth has its obligations. AndI would not be reproached by my fellow-citizens for rash haste inbestowing my daughter. Bartolommeo Scala gave his Alessandra to theGreek Marullo, but Marullo’s lineage was well-known, and Scala himselfis of no extraction. I know Bernardo will hold that we must take time:he will, perhaps, reproach me with want of due forethought. Be patient,my children: you are very young.”</p><p>No more could be said, and Romola’s heart was perfectly satisfied. Notso Tito’s. If the subtle mixture of good and evil prepares sufferingfor human truth and purity, there is also suffering prepared for thewrong-doer by the same mingled conditions. As Tito kissed Romola ontheir parting that evening, the very strength of the thrill that movedhis whole being at the sense that this woman, whose beauty it washardly possible to think of as anything but the necessary consequenceof her noble nature, loved him with all the tenderness that spoke inher clear eyes, brought a strong reaction of regret that he had notkept himself free from that first deceit which had dragged him into thedanger of being disgraced before her. There was a spring of bitternessmingling with that fountain of sweets. Would the death of Fra Lucaarrest it? He hoped it would.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/CYux/GEreader/tree/main/docs/romola/BOOK I/12_CHAPTER_XII.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/GEreader/romola/BOOK I/CHAPTER_XI"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">XI.
