[]</p></div></div><p>CHAPTER XX.The Day of the Betrothal.</p><p>It was the last week of the Carnival, and the streets of Florence wereat their fullest and noisiest: there were the masqued processions,chanting songs, indispensable now they had once been introduced byLorenzo the Magnificent; there was the favourite rigoletto, or rounddance, footed “in piazza” under the blue frosty sky; there werepractical jokes of all sorts, from throwing comfits to throwingstones—especially stones. For the boys and striplings, always a strongelement in Florentine crowds, became at the height of Carnival-time asloud and unmanageable as tree-crickets, and it was their immemorialprivilege to bar the way with poles to all passengers, until a tributehad been paid towards furnishing those lovers of strong sensations withsuppers and bonfires: to conclude with the standing entertainment ofstone-throwing, which was not entirely monotonous, since the consequentmaiming was various, and it was not always a single person who waskilled. So that the pleasures of the Carnival were of a checkered kind,and if a painter were called upon to represent them truly, he wouldhave to make a picture in which there would be so much grossness andbarbarity that it must be turned with its face to the wall, except whenit was taken down for the grave historical purpose of justifying areforming zeal which, in ignorance of the facts, might be unfairlycondemned for its narrowness. Still there was much of that moreinnocent picturesque merriment which is never wanting among a peoplewith quick animal spirits and sensitive organs: there was not the heavysottishness which belongs to the thicker northern blood, nor thestealthy fierceness which in the more southern regions of the peninsulamakes the brawl lead to the dagger-thrust.</p><p>It was the high morning, but the merry spirits of the Carnival werestill inclined to lounge and recapitulate the last night’s jests, whenTito Melema was walking at a brisk pace on the way to the Via de’Bardi. Young Bernardo Dovizi, who now looks at us out of Raphael’sportrait as the keen-eyed Cardinal da Bibbiena, was with him; and, asthey went, they held animated talk about some subject that hadevidently no relation to the sights and sounds through which they werepushing their way along the Por’ Santa Maria. Nevertheless, as theydiscussed, smiled, and gesticulated, they both, from time to time, castquick glances around them, and at the turning towards the Lung’ Arno,leading to the Ponte Rubaconte, Tito had become aware, in one of theserapid surveys, that there was some one not far off him by whom he verymuch desired not to be recognised at that moment. His time and thoughtswere thoroughly preoccupied, for he was looking forward to a uniqueoccasion in his life: he was preparing for his betrothal, which was totake place on the evening of this very day. The ceremony had beenresolved upon rather suddenly; for although preparations towards themarriage had been going forward for some time—chiefly in theapplication of Tito’s florins to the fitting up of rooms in Bardo’sdwelling, which, the library excepted, had always been scantilyfurnished—it had been intended to defer both the betrothal and themarriage until after Easter, when Tito’s year of probation, insisted onby Bernardo del Nero, would have been complete. But when an expressproposition had come, that Tito should follow the Cardinal Giovanni toRome to help Bernardo Dovizi with his superior knowledge of Greek inarranging a library, and there was no possibility of declining what layso plainly on the road to advancement, he had become urgent in hisentreaties that the betrothal might take place before his departure:there would be the less delay before the marriage on his return, and itwould be less painful to part if he and Romola were outwardly as wellas inwardly pledged to each other—if he had a claim which defied MesserBernardo or any one else to nullify it. For the betrothal, at whichrings were exchanged and mutual contracts were signed, made more thanhalf the legality of marriage, to be completed on a separate occasionby the nuptial benediction. Romola’s feeling had met Tito’s in thiswish, and the consent of the elders had been won.</p><p>And now Tito was hastening, amidst arrangements for his departure thenext day, to snatch a morning visit to Romola, to say and hear any lastwords that were needful to be said before their meeting for thebetrothal in the evening. It was not a time when any recognition couldbe pleasant that was at all likely to detain him; still less arecognition by Tessa. And it was unmistakably Tessa whom he had caughtsight of moving along, with a timid and forlorn look, towards that veryturn of the Lung’ Arno which he was just rounding. As he continued histalk with the young Dovizi, he had an uncomfortable undercurrent ofconsciousness which told him that Tessa had seen him and wouldcertainly follow him: there was no escaping her along this direct roadby the Arno, and over the Ponte Rubaconte. But she would not dare tospeak to him or approach him while he was not alone, and he wouldcontinue to keep Dovizi with him till they reached Bardo’s door. Hequickened his pace, and took up new threads of talk; but all the whilethe sense that Tessa was behind him, though he had no physical evidenceof the fact, grew stronger and stronger; it was very irritating—perhapsall the more so because a certain tenderness and pity for the poorlittle thing made the determination to escape without any visiblenotice of her, a not altogether agreeable resource. Yet Tito perseveredand carried his companion to the door, cleverly managing his “addio”without turning his face in a direction where it was possible for himto see an importunate pair of blue eyes; and as he went up the stonesteps, he tried to get rid of unpleasant thoughts by saying to himselfthat after all Tessa might not have seen him, or, if she had, might nothave followed him.</p><p>But—perhaps because that possibility could not be relied onstrongly—when the visit was over, he came out of the doorway with aquick step and an air of unconsciousness as to anything that might beon his right-hand or his left. Our eyes are so constructed, however,that they take in a wide angle without asking any leave of our will;and Tito knew that there was a little figure in a white hood standingnear the doorway—knew it quite well, before he felt a hand laid on hisarm. It was a real grasp, and not a light, timid touch; for poor Tessa,seeing his rapid step, had started forward with a desperate effort. Butwhen he stopped and turned towards her, her face wore a frightenedlook, as if she dreaded the effect of her boldness.</p><p>“Tessa!” said Tito, with more sharpness in his voice than she had everheard in it before. “Why are you here? You must not follow me—you mustnot stand about door-places waiting for me.”</p><p>Her blue eyes widened with tears, and she said nothing. Tito was afraidof something worse than ridicule, if he were seen in the Via de’ Bardiwith a girlish contadina looking pathetically at him. It was a streetof high silent-looking dwellings, not of traffic; but Bernardo delNero, or some one almost as dangerous, might come up at any moment.Even if it had not been the day of his betrothal, the incident wouldhave been awkward and annoying. Yet it would be brutal—it wasimpossible—to drive Tessa away with harsh words. That accursed folly ofhis with the <em>cerretano</em>—that it should have lain buried in a quiet wayfor months, and now start up before him as this unseasonable crop ofvexation! He could not speak harshly, but he spoke hurriedly.</p><p>“Tessa, I cannot—must not talk to you here. I will go on to the bridgeand wait for you there. Follow me slowly.”</p><p>He turned and walked fast to the Ponte Rubaconte, and there leanedagainst the wall of one of the quaint little houses that rise at evendistances on the bridge, looking towards the way by which Tessa wouldcome. It would have softened a much harder heart than Tito’s to see thelittle thing advancing with her round face much paled and saddenedsince he had parted from it at the door of the “Nunziata.” Happily itwas the least frequented of the bridges, and there were scarcely anypassengers on it at this moment. He lost no time in speaking as soon asshe came near him.</p><p>“Now, Tessa, I have very little time. You must not cry. Why did youfollow me this morning? You must not do so again.”</p><p>“I thought,” said Tessa, speaking in a whisper, and struggling againsta sob that <em>would</em> rise immediately at this new voice of Tito’s—“Ithought you wouldn’t be so long before you came to take care of meagain. And the <em>patrigno</em> beats me, and I can’t bear it any longer. Andalways when I come for a holiday I walk about to find you, and I can’t.Oh, please don’t send me away from you again! It has been so long, andI cry so now, because you never come to me. I can’t help it, for thedays are so long, and I don’t mind about the goats and kids, oranything—and I can’t—”</p><p>The sobs came fast now, and the great tears. Tito felt that he couldnot do otherwise than comfort her. Send her away—yes; that he _must_do, at once. But it was all the more impossible to tell her anythingthat would leave her in a state of hopeless grief. He saw new troublein the background, but the difficulty of the moment was too pressingfor him to weigh distant consequences.</p><p>“Tessa, my little one,” he said, in his old caressing tones, “you mustnot cry. Bear with the cross <em>patrigno</em> a little longer. I will comeback to you. But I’m going now to Rome—a long, long way off. I shallcome back in a few weeks, and then I promise you to come and see you.Promise me to be good and wait for me.”</p><p>It was the well-remembered voice again, and the mere sound was halfenough to soothe Tessa. She looked up at him with trusting eyes, thatstill glittered with tears, sobbing all the while, in spite of herutmost efforts to obey him. Again he said, in a gentle voice—</p><p>“Promise me, my Tessa.”</p><p>“Yes,” she whispered. “But you won’t be long?”</p><p>“No, not long. But I must <em>go now</em>. And remember what I told you,Tessa. Nobody must know that you ever see me, else you will lose me forever. And now, when I have left you, go straight home, and never followme again. Wait till I come to you. Good-bye, my little Tessa: I _will_come.”</p><p>There was no help for it; he must turn and leave her without lookingbehind him to see how she bore it, for he had no time to spare. When hedid look round he was in the Via de’ Benci, where there was no seeingwhat was happening on the bridge; but Tessa was too trusting andobedient not to do just what he had told her.</p><p>Yes, the difficulty was at an end for that day; yet this return ofTessa to him, at a moment when it was impossible for him to put an endto all difficulty with her by undeceiving her, was an unpleasantincident to carry in his memory. But Tito’s mind was just nowthoroughly penetrated with a hopeful first love, associated with allhappy prospects flattering to his ambition; and that future necessityof grieving Tessa could be scarcely more to him than the far-off cry ofsome little suffering animal buried in the thicket, to a merrycavalcade in the sunny plain. When, for the second time that day, Titowas hastening across the Ponte Rubaconte, the thought of Tessa causedno perceptible diminution of his happiness. He was well muffled in hismantle, less, perhaps, to protect him from the cold than from theadditional notice that would have been drawn upon him by his daintyapparel. He leaped up the stone steps by two at a time, and saidhurriedly to Maso, who met him—</p><p>“Where is the damigella?”</p><p>“In the library; she is quite ready, and Monna Brigida and MesserBernardo are already there with Ser Braccio, but none of the rest ofthe company.”</p><p>“Ask her to give me a few minutes alone; I will await her in the<em>salotto</em>.”</p><p>Tito entered a room which had been fitted up in the utmost contrastwith the half-pallid, half-sombre tints of the library. The walls werebrightly frescoed with “caprices” of nymphs and loves sporting underthe blue among flowers and birds. The only furniture besides the redleather seats and the central table were two tall white vases, and ayoung faun playing the flute, modelled by a promising youth namedMichelangelo Buonarotti. It was a room that gave a sense of being inthe sunny open air.</p><p>Tito kept his mantle round him, and looked towards the door. It was notlong before Romola entered, all white and gold, more than ever like atall lily. Her white silk garment was bound by a golden girdle, whichfell with large tassels; and above that was the rippling gold of herhair, surmounted by the white mist of her long veil, which was fastenedon her brow by a band of pearls, the gift of Bernardo del Nero, and wasnow parted off her face so that it all floated backward.</p><p>“Regina mia!” said Tito, as he took her hand and kissed it, stillkeeping his mantle round him. He could not help going backward to lookat her again, while she stood in calm delight, with that exquisiteself-consciousness which rises under the gaze of admiring love.</p><p>“Romola, will you show me the next room now?” said Tito, checkinghimself with the remembrance that the time might be short. “You said Ishould see it when you had arranged everything.”</p><p>Without speaking, she led the way into a long narrow room, paintedbrightly like the other, but only with birds and flowers. The furniturein it was all old; there were old faded objects for feminine use orornament, arranged in an open cabinet between the two narrow windows;above the cabinet was the portrait of Romola’s mother; and below this,on the top of the cabinet, stood the crucifix which Romola had broughtfrom San Marco.</p><p>“I have brought something under my mantle,” said Tito, smiling; andthrowing off the large loose garment, he showed the little tabernaclewhich had been painted by Piero di Cosimo. The painter had carried outTito’s intention charmingly, and so far had atoned for his long delay.“Do you know what this is for, my Romola?” added Tito, taking her bythe hand, and leading her towards the cabinet. “It is a little shrine,which is to hide away from you for ever that remembrancer of sadness.You have done with sadness now; and we will bury all images of it—burythem in a tomb of joy. See!”</p><p>A slight quiver passed across Romola’s face as Tito took hold of thecrucifix. But she had no wish to prevent his purpose; on the contrary,she herself wished to subdue certain importunate memories andquestionings which still flitted like unexplained shadows across herhappier thought.</p><p>He opened the triptych and placed the crucifix within the centralspace; then closing it again, taking out the key, and setting thelittle tabernacle in the spot where the crucifix had stood, said—</p><p>“Now, Romola, look and see if you are satisfied with the portraits oldPiero has made of us. Is it not a dainty device? and the credit ofchoosing it is mine.”</p><p>“Ah! it is you—it is perfect!” said Romola, looking with moist joyfuleyes at the miniature Bacchus, with his purple clusters. “And I amAriadne, and you are crowning me! Yes, it is true, Tito; you havecrowned my poor life.”</p><p>They held each other’s hands while she spoke, and both looked at theirimaged selves. But the reality was far more beautiful; she alllily-white and golden, and he with his dark glowing beauty above thepurple red-bordered tunic.</p><p>“And it was our good strange Piero who painted it?” said Romola. “Didyou put it into his head to paint me as Antigone, that he might have mylikeness for this?”</p><p>“No, it was he who made my getting leave for him to paint you and yourfather, a condition of his doing this for me.”</p><p>“Ah! I see now what it was you gave up your precious ring for. Iperceived you had some cunning plan to give me pleasure.”</p><p>Tito did not blench. Romola’s little illusions about himself had longceased to cause him anything but satisfaction. He only smiled and said—</p><p>“I might have spared my ring; Piero will accept no money from me; hethinks himself paid by painting you. And now, while I am away, you willlook every day at those pretty symbols of our life together—the ship onthe calm sea, and the ivy that never withers, and those Loves that haveleft off wounding us and shower soft petals that are like our kisses;and the leopards and tigers, they are the troubles of your life thatare all quelled now; and the strange sea-monsters, with their merryeyes—let us see—they are the dull passages in the heavy books, whichhave begun to be amusing since we have sat by each other.”</p><p>“Tito mio!” said Romola, in a half-laughing voice of love; “but youwill give me the key?” she added, holding out her hand for it.</p><p>“Not at all!” said Tito, with playful decision, opening his scarsellaand dropping in the little key. “I shall drown it in the Arno.”</p><p>“But if I ever wanted to look at the crucifix again?”</p><p>“Ah! for that very reason it is hidden—hidden by these images of youthand joy.”</p><p>He pressed a light kiss on her brow, and she said no more, ready tosubmit, like all strong souls, when she felt no valid reason forresistance.</p><p>And then they joined the waiting company, which made a dignified littleprocession as it passed along the Ponte Rubaconte towards Santa Croce.Slowly it passed, for Bardo, unaccustomed for years to leave his ownhouse, walked with a more timid step than usual; and that slow pacesuited well with the gouty dignity of Messer Bartolommeo Scala, whograced the occasion by his presence, along with his daughterAlessandra. It was customary to have very long troops of kindred andfriends at the <em>sposalizio</em>, or betrothal, and it had even been foundnecessary in time past to limit the number by law to no more than <em>fourhundred</em>—two hundred on each side; for since the guests were allfeasted after this initial ceremony, as well as after the <em>nozze</em>, ormarriage, the very first stage of matrimony had become a ruinousexpense, as that scholarly Benedict, Leonardo Bruno, complained in hisown case. But Bardo, who in his poverty had kept himself proudly freefrom any appearance of claiming the advantages attached to a powerfulfamily name, would have no invitations given on the strength of merefriendship; and the modest procession of twenty that followed the<em>sposi</em> were, with three or four exceptions, friends of Bardo’s andTito’s selected on personal grounds.</p><p>Bernardo del Nero walked as a vanguard before Bardo, who was led on theright by Tito, while Romola held her father’s other hand. Bardo hadhimself been married at Santa Croce, and had insisted on Romola’s beingbetrothed and married there, rather than in the little church of SantaLucia close by their house, because he had a complete mental vision ofthe grand church where he hoped that a burial might be granted himamong the Florentines who had deserved well. Happily the way was shortand direct, and lay aloof from the loudest riot of the Carnival, ifonly they could return before any dances or shows began in the greatpiazza of Santa Croce. The west was red as they passed the bridge, andshed a mellow light on the pretty procession, which had a touch ofsolemnity in the presence of the blind father. But when the ceremonywas over, and Tito and Romola came out on to the broad steps of thechurch, with the golden links of destiny on their fingers, the eveninghad deepened into struggling starlight, and the servants had theirtorches lit.</p><p>While they came out, a strange dreary chant, as of a <em>Miserere</em>, mettheir ears, and they saw that at the extreme end of the piazza thereseemed to be a stream of people impelled by something approaching fromthe Borgo de’ Greci.</p><p>“It is one of their masqued processions, I suppose,” said Tito, who wasnow alone with Romola, while Bernardo took charge of Bardo.</p><p>And as he spoke there came slowly into view, at a height far above theheads of the onlookers, a huge and ghastly image of Winged Time withhis scythe and hour-glass, surrounded by his winged children, theHours. He was mounted on a high car completely covered with black, andthe bullocks that drew the car were also covered with black, theirhorns alone standing out white above the gloom; so that in the sombreshadow of the houses it seemed to those at a distance as if Time andhis children were apparitions floating through the air. And behind themcame what looked like a troop of the sheeted dead gliding aboveblackness. And as they glided slowly, they chanted in a wailing strain.</p><p>A cold horror seized on Romola, for at the first moment it seemed as ifher brother’s vision, which could never be effaced from her mind, wasbeing half fulfilled. She clung to Tito, who, divining what was in herthoughts, said—</p><p>“What dismal fooling sometimes pleases your Florentines! Doubtless thisis an invention of Piero di Cosimo, who loves such grim merriment.”</p><p>“Tito, I wish it had not happened. It will deepen the images of thatvision which I would fain be rid of.”</p><p>“Nay, Romola, you will look only at the images of our happiness now. Ihave locked all sadness away from you.”</p><p>“But it is still there—it is only hidden,” said Romola, in a low tone,hardly conscious that she spoke.</p><p>“See, they are all gone now!” said Tito. “You will forget this ghastlymummery when we are in the light, and can see each other’s eyes. MyAriadne must never look backward now—only forward to Easter, when shewill triumph with her Care-dispeller.”</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/CYux/GEreader/tree/main/docs/romola/BOOK I/20_CHAPTER_XX.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/GEreader/romola/BOOK I/CHAPTER_XIX"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">XIX.
