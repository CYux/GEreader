In Chapter V of &quot;Romola&quot;, we see the relationship between Romola and her blind father, Bardo de&#x27; Bardi, as they live together in their home in Florence during the late 15th century. Bardo is a proud, aging scholar who laments the loss of his sight and the absence of his son, who has abandoned his family to join a religious order. Romola is a dutiful, intelligent, and strong-willed young woman who helps her father with his scholarly work and hopes to someday marry a learned man who will value her knowledge and share her father&#x27;s love of scholarship.</p><p><strong>Main Characters</strong>:

It extends from the Ponte Vecchio to the Piazza de’ Mozziat the head of the Ponte alle Grazie; its right-hand line of houses andwalls being backed by the rather steep ascent which in the fifteenthcentury was known as the hill of Bogoli, the famous stone-quarry whencethe city got its pavement—of dangerously unstable consistence whenpenetrated by rains; its left-hand buildings flanking the river andmaking on their northern side a length of quaint, irregularly-piercedfaçade, of which the waters give a softened loving reflection as thesun begins to decline towards the western heights. But quaint as thesebuildings are, some of them seem to the historical memory a too modernsubstitute for the famous houses of the Bardi family, destroyed bypopular rage in the middle of the fourteenth century.</p><p>They were a proud and energetic stock, these Bardi; conspicuous amongthose who clutched the sword in the earliest world-famous quarrels ofFlorentines with Florentines, when the narrow streets were darkenedwith the high towers of the nobles, and when the old tutelar god Mars,as he saw the gutters reddened with neighbours’ blood, might well havesmiled at the centuries of lip-service paid to his rival, the Baptist.But the Bardi hands were of the sort that not only clutch thesword-hilt with vigour, but love the more delicate pleasure offingering minted metal: they were matched, too, with true Florentineeyes, capable of discerning that power was to be won by other meansthan by rending and riving, and by the middle of the fourteenth centurywe find them risen from their original condition of <em>popolani</em> to bepossessors, by purchase, of lands and strongholds, and the feudaldignity of Counts of Vernio, disturbing to the jealousy of theirrepublican fellow-citizens. These lordly purchases are explained by ourseeing the Bardi disastrously signalised only a few years later asstanding in the very front of European commerce—the ChristianRothschilds of that time—undertaking to furnish specie for the wars ofour Edward the Third, and having revenues “in kind” made over to them;especially in wool, most precious of freights for Florentine galleys.Their august debtor left them with an august deficit, and alarmedSicilian creditors made a too sudden demand for the payment ofdeposits, causing a ruinous shock to the credit of the Bardi and ofassociated houses, which was felt as a commercial calamity along allthe coasts of the Mediterranean. But, like more modern bankrupts, theydid not, for all that, hide their heads in humiliation; on thecontrary, they seemed to have held them higher than ever, and to havebeen among the most arrogant of those grandees, who under certainnoteworthy circumstances, open to all who will read the honest pages ofGiovanni Villani, drew upon themselves the exasperation of the armedpeople in 1343. The Bardi, who had made themselves fast in their streetbetween the two bridges, kept these narrow inlets, like panthers atbay, against the oncoming gonfalons of the people, and were only madeto give way by an assault from the hill behind them. Their houses bythe river, to the number of twenty-two (<em>palagi e case grandi</em>), weresacked and burnt, and many among the chief of those who bore the Bardiname were driven from the city. But an old Florentine family wasmany-rooted, and we find the Bardi maintaining importance and risingagain and again to the surface of Florentine affairs in a more or lesscreditable manner, implying an untold family history that would haveincluded even more vicissitudes and contrasts of dignity and disgrace,of wealth and poverty, than are usually seen on the background of widekinship.<!-- -->[1]<!-- --> But the Bardi never resumed their proprietorship in the oldstreet on the banks of the river, which in 1492 had long beenassociated with other names of mark, and especially with the Neri, whopossessed a considerable range of houses on the side towards the hill.</p><p>[1]<!-- --> A sign that such contrasts were peculiarly frequent in Florence,is the fact that Saint Antonine, Prior of San Marco, and afterwardsarchbishop, in the first half of this fifteenth century, founded thesociety of Buonuomini di San Martino (Good Men of Saint Martin) withthe main object of succouring the <em>poveri vergognosi</em>—in other words,paupers of good family. In the records of the famous Panciatichifamily we find a certain Girolamo in this century who was reduced tosuch a state of poverty that he was obliged to seek charity for themere means of sustaining life, though other members of his family wereenormously wealthy.</p><p>In one of these Neri houses there lived, however, a descendant of theBardi, and of that very branch which a century and a half before hadbecome Counts of Vernio: a descendant who had inherited the old familypride and energy, the old love of pre-eminence, the old desire to leavea lasting track of his footsteps on the fast-whirling earth. But thefamily passions lived on in him under altered conditions: thisdescendant of the Bardi was not a man swift in street warfare, or onewho loved to play the signor, fortifying strongholds and asserting theright to hang vassals, or a merchant and usurer of keen daring, whodelighted in the generalship of wide commercial schemes: he was a manwith a deep-veined hand cramped by much copying of manuscripts, who atesparing dinners, and wore threadbare clothes, at first from choice andat last from necessity; who sat among his books and his marblefragments of the past, and saw them only by the light of those far-offyounger days which still shone in his memory: he was a moneyless, blindold scholar—the Bardo de’ Bardi to whom Nello, the barber, had promisedto introduce the young Greek, Tito Melema.</p><p>The house in which Bardo lived was situated on the side of the streetnearest the hill, and was one of those large sombre masses of stonebuilding pierced by comparatively small windows, and surmounted by whatmay be called a roofed terrace or loggia, of which there are manyexamples still to be seen in the venerable city. Grim doors, withconspicuous scrolled hinges, having high up on each side of them asmall window defended by iron bars, opened on a groined entrance-court,empty of everything but a massive lamp-iron suspended from the centreof the groin. A smaller grim door on the left-hand admitted to thestone staircase, and the rooms on the ground-floor. These last wereused as a warehouse by the proprietor; so was the first floor; and bothwere filled with precious stores, destined to be carried, some perhapsto the banks of the Scheldt, some to the shores of Africa, some to theisles of the Aegean, or to the banks of the Euxine. Maso, the oldserving-man, when he returned from the Mercato with the stock of cheapvegetables, had to make his slow way up to the second storey before hereached the door of his master, Bardo, through which we are about toenter only a few mornings after Nello’s conversation with the Greek.</p><p>We follow Maso across the ante-chamber to the door on the left-hand,through which we pass as he opens it. He merely looks in and nods,while a clear young voice says, “Ah, you are come back, Maso. It iswell. We have wanted nothing.”</p><p>The voice came from the farther end of a long, spacious room,surrounded with shelves, on which books and antiquities were arrangedin scrupulous order. Here and there, on separate stands in front of theshelves, were placed a beautiful feminine torso; a headless statue,with an uplifted muscular arm wielding a bladeless sword; rounded,dimpled, infantine limbs severed from the trunk, inviting the lips tokiss the cold marble; some well-preserved Roman busts; and two or threevases from Magna Grecia. A large table in the centre was covered withantique bronze lamps and small vessels in dark pottery. The colour ofthese objects was chiefly pale or sombre: the vellum bindings, withtheir deep-ridged backs, gave little relief to the marble, livid withlong burial; the once splendid patch of carpet at the farther end ofthe room had long been worn to dimness; the dark bronzes wantedsunlight upon them to bring out their tinge of green, and the sun wasnot yet high enough to send gleams of brightness through the narrowwindows that looked on the Via de’ Bardi.</p><p>The only spot of bright colour in the room was made by the hair of atall maiden of seventeen or eighteen, who was standing before a carved<em>leggio</em>, or reading-desk, such as is often seen in the choirs ofItalian churches. The hair was of a reddish gold colour, enriched by anunbroken small ripple, such as may be seen in the sunset clouds ongrandest autumnal evenings. It was confined by a black fillet above hersmall ears, from which it rippled forward again, and made a naturalveil for her neck above her square-cut gown of black <em>rascia</em>, orserge. Her eyes were bent on a large volume placed before her: one longwhite hand rested on the reading-desk, and the other clasped the backof her father’s chair.</p><p>The blind father sat with head uplifted and turned a little asidetowards his daughter, as if he were looking at her. His delicatepaleness, set off by the black velvet cap which surmounted his droopingwhite hair, made all the more perceptible the likeness between his agedfeatures and those of the young maiden, whose cheeks were also withoutany tinge of the rose. There was the same refinement of brow andnostril in both, counterbalanced by a full though firm mouth andpowerful chin, which gave an expression of proud tenacity and latentimpetuousness: an expression carried out in the backward poise of thegirl’s head, and the grand line of her neck and shoulders. It was atype of face of which one could not venture to say whether it wouldinspire love or only that unwilling admiration which is mixed withdread: the question must be decided by the eyes, which often seemcharged with a more direct message from the soul. But the eyes of thefather had long been silent, and the eyes of the daughter were bent onthe Latin pages of Politian’s ‘Miscellanea,’ from which she was readingaloud at the eightieth chapter, to the following effect:—</p><p>“There was a certain nymph of Thebes named Chariclo, especially dear toPallas; and this nymph was the mother of Teiresias. But once when inthe heat of summer, Pallas, in company with Chariclo, was bathing herdisrobed limbs in the Heliconian Hippocrene, it happened that Teiresiascoming as a hunter to quench his thirst at the same fountain,inadvertently beheld Minerva unveiled, and immediately became blind.For it is declared in the Saturnian laws, that he who beholds the godsagainst their will, shall atone for it by a heavy penalty... WhenTeiresias had fallen into this calamity, Pallas, moved by the tears ofChariclo, endowed him with prophecy and length of days, and even causedhis prudence and wisdom to continue after he had entered among theshades, so that an oracle spake from his tomb: and she gave him astaff, wherewith, as by a guide, he might walk without stumbling... Andhence, Nonnus, in the fifth book of the ‘Dionysiaca,’ introducesActreon exclaiming that he calls Teiresias happy, since, without dying,and with the loss of his eyesight merely, he had beheld Minervaunveiled, and thus, though blind, could for evermore carry her image inhis soul.”</p><p>At this point in the reading, the daughter’s hand slipped from the backof the chair and met her father’s, which he had that moment uplifted;but she had not looked round, and was going on, though with a voice alittle altered by some suppressed feeling, to read the Greek quotationfrom Nonnus, when the old man said—</p><p>“Stay, Romola; reach me my own copy of Nonnus. It is a more correctcopy than any in Poliziano’s hands, for I made emendations in it whichhave not yet been communicated to any man. I finished it in 1477, whenmy sight was fast failing me.”</p><p>Romola walked to the farther end of the room, with the queenly stepwhich was the simple action of her tall, finely-wrought frame, withoutthe slightest conscious adjustment of herself.</p><p>“Is it in the right place, Romola?” asked Bardo, who was perpetuallyseeking the assurance that the outward fact continued to correspondwith the image which lived to the minutest detail in his mind.</p><p>“Yes, father; at the west end of the room, on the third shelf from thebottom, behind the bust of Hadrian, above Apollonius Rhodius andCallimachus, and below Lucan and Silius Italicus.”</p><p>As Romola said this, a fine ear would have detected in her clear voiceand distinct utterance, a faint suggestion of weariness struggling withhabitual patience. But as she approached her father and saw his armsstretched out a little with nervous excitement to seize the volume, herhazel eyes filled with pity; she hastened to lay the book on his lap,and kneeled down by him, looking up at him as if she believed that thelove in her face must surely make its way through the dark obstructionthat shut out everything else. At that moment the doubtfulattractiveness of Romola’s face, in which pride and passion seemed tobe quivering in the balance with native refinement and intelligence,was transfigured to the most lovable womanliness by mingled pity andaffection: it was evident that the deepest fount of feeling within herhad not yet wrought its way to the less changeful features, and onlyfound its outlet through her eyes.</p><p>But the father, unconscious of that soft radiance, looked flushed andagitated as his hand explored the edges and back of the large book.</p><p>“The vellum is yellowed in these thirteen years, Romola.”</p><p>“Yes, father,” said Romola, gently; “but your letters at the back aredark and plain still—fine Roman letters; and the Greek character,” shecontinued, laying the book open on her father’s knee, “is morebeautiful than that of any of your bought manuscripts.”</p><p>“Assuredly, child,” said Bardo, passing his finger across the page, asif he hoped to discriminate line and margin. “What hired amanuensis canbe equal to the scribe who loves the words that grow under his hand,and to whom an error or indistinctness in the text is more painful thana sudden darkness or obstacle across his path? And even thesemechanical printers who threaten to make learning a base and vulgarthing—even they must depend on the manuscript over which we scholarshave bent with that insight into the poet’s meaning which is closelyakin to the <em>mens divinior</em> of the poet himself; unless they wouldflood the world with grammatical falsities and inexplicable anomaliesthat would turn the very fountain of Parnassus into a deluge ofpoisonous mud. But find the passage in the fifth book, to whichPoliziano refers—I know it very well.”</p><p>Seating herself on a low stool, close to her father’s knee, Romola tookthe book on her lap and read the four verses containing the exclamationof Actreon.</p><p>“It is true, Romola,” said Bardo, when she had finished; “it is a trueconception of the poet; for what is that grosser, narrower light bywhich men behold merely the petty scene around them, compared with thatfar-stretching, lasting light which spreads over centuries of thought,and over the life of nations, and makes clear to us the minds of theimmortals who have reaped the great harvest and left us to glean intheir furrows? For me, Romola, even when I could see, it was with thegreat dead that I lived; while the living often seemed to me merespectres—shadows dispossessed of true feeling and intelligence; andunlike those Lamiae, to whom Poliziano, with that superficial ingenuitywhich I do not deny to him, compares our inquisitive Florentines,because they put on their eyes when they went abroad, and took them offwhen they got home again, I have returned from the converse of thestreets as from a forgotten dream, and have sat down among my books,saying with Petrarca, the modern who is least unworthy to be namedafter the ancients, ‘Libri medullitus delectant, colloquuntur,consulunt, et viva quadam nobis atque arguta familiaritate junguntur.’”</p><p>“And in one thing you are happier than your favourite Petrarca,father,” said Romola, affectionately humouring the old man’sdisposition to dilate in this way; “for he used to look at his copy ofHomer and think sadly that the Greek was a dead letter to him: so far,he had the inward blindness that you feel is worse than your outwardblindness.”</p><p>“True, child; for I carry within me the fruits of that fervid studywhich I gave to the Greek tongue under the teaching of the youngerCrisolora, and Filelfo, and Argiropulo; though that great work in whichI had desired to gather, as into a firm web, all the threads that myresearch had laboriously disentangled, and which would have been thevintage of my life, was cut off by the failure of my sight and my wantof a fitting coadjutor. For the sustained zeal and unconquerablepatience demanded from those who would tread the unbeaten paths ofknowledge are still less reconcilable with the wandering, vagrantpropensity of the feminine mind than with the feeble powers of thefeminine body.”</p><p>“Father,” said Romola, with a sudden flush and in an injured tone, “Iread anything you wish me to read; and I will look out any passages foryou, and make whatever notes you want.”</p><p>Bardo shook his head, and smiled with a bitter sort of pity. “As welltry to be a pentathlos and perform all the five feats of the palaestrawith the limbs of a nymph. Have I forgotten thy fainting in the meresearch for the references I needed to explain a single passage ofCallimachus?”</p><p>“But, father, it was the weight of the books, and Maso can help me; itwas not want of attention and patience.”</p><p>Bardo shook his head again. “It is not mere bodily organs that I want:it is the sharp edge of a young mind to pierce the way for my somewhatblunted faculties. For blindness acts like a dam, sending the streamsof thought backward along the already-travelled channels and hinderingthe course onward. If my son had not forsaken me, deluded by debasingfanatical dreams, worthy only of an energumen whose dwelling is amongtombs, I might have gone on and seen my path broadening to the end ofmy life; for he was a youth of great promise. But it has closed innow,” the old man continued, after a short pause; “it has closed innow;—all but the narrow track he has left me to tread—alone in myblindness.”</p><p>Romola started from her seat, and carried away the large volume to itsplace again, stung too acutely by her father’s last words to remainmotionless as well as silent; and when she turned away from the shelfagain, she remained standing at some distance from him, stretching herarms downwards and clasping her fingers tightly as she looked with asad dreariness in her young face at the lifeless objects around her—theparchment backs, the unchanging mutilated marble, the bits of obsoletebronze and clay.</p><p>Bardo, though usually susceptible to Romola’s movements and eager totrace them, was now too entirely preoccupied by the pain of ranklingmemories to notice her departure from his side.</p><p>“Yes,” he went on, “with my son to aid me, I might have had my dueshare in the triumphs of this century: the names of the Bardi, fatherand son, might have been held reverently on the lips of scholars in theages to come; not on account of frivolous verses or philosophicaltreatises, which are superfluous and presumptuous attempts to imitatethe inimitable, such as allure vain men like Panhormita, and from whicheven the admirable Poggio did not keep himself sufficiently free; butbecause we should have given a lamp whereby men might have studied thesupreme productions of the past. For why is a young man like Poliziano(who was not yet born when I was already held worthy to maintain adiscussion with Thomas of Sarzana) to have a glorious memory as acommentator on the Pandects—why is Ficino, whose Latin is an offence tome, and who wanders purblind among the superstitious fancies thatmarked the decline at once of art, literature, and philosophy, todescend to posterity as the very high priest of Platonism, while I, whoam more than their equal, have not effected anything but scatteredwork, which will be appropriated by other men? Why? but because my son,whom I had brought up to replenish my ripe learning with youngenterprise, left me and all liberal pursuits that he might lash himselfand howl at midnight with besotted friars—that he might go wandering onpilgrimages befitting men who know of no past older than the missal andthe crucifix?—left me when the night was already beginning to fall onme.”</p><p>In these last words the old man’s voice, which had risen high inindignant protest, fell into a tone of reproach so tremulous andplaintive that Romola, turning her eyes again towards the blind agedface, felt her heart swell with forgiving pity. She seated herself byher father again, and placed her hand on his knee—too proud to obtrudeconsolation in words that might seem like a vindication of her ownvalue, yet wishing to comfort him by some sign of her presence.</p><p>“Yes, Romola,” said Bardo, automatically letting his left-hand, withits massive prophylactic rings, fall a little too heavily on thedelicate blue-veined back of the girl’s right, so that she bit her lipto prevent herself from starting. “If even Florence only is to rememberme, it can but be on the same ground that it will remember NiccolòNiccoli—because I forsook the vulgar pursuit of wealth in commerce thatI might devote myself to collecting the precious remains of ancient artand wisdom, and leave them, after the example of the munificent Romans,for an everlasting possession to my fellow-citizens. But why do I sayFlorence only? If Florence remembers me, will not the world rememberme? ... Yet,” added Bardo, after a short pause, his voice falling againinto a saddened key, “Lorenzo’s untimely death has raised a newdifficulty. I had his promise—I should have had his bond—that mycollection should always bear my name and should never be sold, thoughthe harpies might clutch everything else; but there is enough forthem—there is more than enough—and for thee, too, Romola, there will beenough. Besides, thou wilt marry; Bernardo reproaches me that I do notseek a fitting <em>parentado</em> for thee, and we will delay no longer, wewill think about it.”</p><p>“No, no, father; what could you do? besides, it is useless: wait tillsome one seeks me,” said Romola, hastily.</p><p>“Nay, my child, that is not the paternal duty. It was not so held bythe ancients, and in this respect Florentines have not degenerated fromtheir ancestral customs.”</p><p>“But I will study diligently,” said Romola, her eyes dilating withanxiety. “I will become as learned as Cassandra Fedele: I will try andbe as useful to you as if I had been a boy, and then perhaps some greatscholar will want to marry me, and will not mind about a dowry; and hewill like to come and live with you, and he will be to you in place ofmy brother... and you will not be sorry that I was a daughter.”</p><p>There was a rising sob in Romola’s voice as she said the last words,which touched the fatherly fibre in Bardo. He stretched his hand upwarda little in search of her golden hair, and as she placed her head underhis hand, he gently stroked it, leaning towards her as if his eyesdiscerned some glimmer there.</p><p>“Nay, Romola mia, I said not so; if I have pronounced an anathema on adegenerate and ungrateful son, I said not that I could wish thee otherthan the sweet daughter thou hast been to me. For what son could havetended me so gently in the frequent sickness I have had of late? Andeven in learning thou art not, according to thy measure, contemptible.Something perhaps were to be wished in thy capacity of attention andmemory, not incompatible even with the feminine mind. But as Calcondilabore testimony, when he aided me to teach thee, thou hast a readyapprehension, and even a wide-glancing intelligence. And thou hast aman’s nobility of soul: thou hast never fretted me with thy pettydesires as thy mother did. It is true, I have been careful to keep theealoof from the debasing influence of thy own sex, with theirsparrow-like frivolity and their enslaving superstition, except,indeed, from that of our cousin Brigida, who may well serve as ascarecrow and a warning. And though—since I agree with the divinePetrarca, when he declares, quoting the ‘Aulularia’ of Plautus, whoagain was indebted for the truth to the supreme Greek intellect,‘Optimam foeminam nullam esse, alia licet alia pejor sit’—I cannotboast that thou art entirely lifted out of that lower category to whichNature assigned thee, nor even that in erudition thou art on a par withthe more learned women of this age; thou art, nevertheless—yes, Romolamia,” said the old man, his pedantry again melting into tenderness,“thou art my sweet daughter, and thy voice is as the lower notes of theflute, ‘dulcis, durabilis, clara, pura, secans aëra et auribus sedens,’according to the choice words of Quintilian; and Bernardo tells me thouart fair, and thy hair is like the brightness of the morning, andindeed it seems to me that I discern some radiance from thee. Ah! Iknow how all else looks in this room, but thy form I only guess at.Thou art no longer the little woman six years old, that faded for meinto darkness; thou art tall, and thy arm is but little below mine. Letus walk together.”</p><p>The old man rose, and Romola, soothed by these beams of tenderness,looked happy again as she drew his arm within hers, and placed in hisright-hand the stick which rested at the side of his chair. While Bardohad been sitting, he had seemed hardly more than sixty: his face,though pale, had that refined texture in which wrinkles and lines arenever deep; but now that he began to walk he looked as old as he reallywas—rather more than seventy; for his tall spare frame had thestudent’s stoop of the shoulders, and he stepped with the undecidedgait of the blind.</p><p>“No, Romola,” he said, pausing against the bust of Hadrian, and passinghis stick from the right to the left that he might explore the familiaroutline with a “seeing hand.” “There will be nothing else to preservemy memory and carry down my name as a member of the great republic ofletters—nothing but my library and my collection of antiquities. Andthey are choice,” continued Bardo, pressing the bust and speaking in atone of insistence. “The collections of Niccolò I know were larger; buttake any collection which is the work of a single man—that of the greatBoccaccio even—mine will surpass it. That of Poggio was contemptiblecompared with mine. It will be a great gift to unborn scholars. Andthere is nothing else. For even if I were to yield to the wish of AldoManuzio when he sets up his press at Venice, and give him the aid of myannotated manuscripts, I know well what would be the result: some otherscholar’s name would stand on the title-page of the edition—somescholar who would have fed on my honey, and then declared in hispreface that he had gathered it all himself fresh from Hymettus. Else,why have I refused the loan of many an annotated codex? why have Irefused to make public any of my translations? why? but becausescholarship is a system of licenced robbery, and your man in scarletand furred robe who sits in judgment on thieves, is himself a thief ofthe thoughts and the fame that belong to his fellows. But against thatrobbery Bardo de’ Bardi shall struggle—though blind and forsaken, heshall struggle. I too have a right to be remembered—as great a right asPontanus or Merula, whose names will be foremost on the lips ofposterity, because they sought patronage and found it; because they hadtongues that could flatter, and blood that was used to be nourishedfrom the client’s basket. I have a right to be remembered.”</p><p>The old man’s voice had become at once loud and tremulous, and a pinkflush overspread his proud, delicately-cut features, while thehabitually raised attitude of his head gave the idea that behind thecurtain of his blindness he saw some imaginary high tribunal to whichhe was appealing against the injustice of Fame.</p><p>Romola was moved with sympathetic indignation, for in her nature toothere lay the same large claims, and the same spirit of struggleagainst their denial. She tried to calm her father by a still prouderword than his.</p><p>“Nevertheless, father, it is a great gift of the gods to be born with ahatred and contempt of all injustice and meanness. Yours is a higherlot, never to have lied and truckled, than to have shared honours wonby dishonour. There is strength in scorn, as there was in the martialfury by which men became insensible to wounds.”</p><p>“It is well said, Romola. It is a Promethean word thou hast uttered,”answered Bardo, after a little interval in which he had begun to leanon his stick again, and to walk on. “And I indeed am not to be piercedby the shafts of Fortune. My armour is the <em>aes triplex</em> of a clearconscience, and a mind nourished by the precepts of philosophy. ‘Formen,’ says Epictetus, ‘are disturbed not by things themselves, but bytheir opinions or thoughts concerning those things.’ And again,‘whosoever will be free, let him not desire or dread that which it isin the power of others either to deny or inflict: otherwise, he is aslave.’ And of all such gifts as are dependent on the caprice offortune or of men, I have long ago learned to say, with Horace—who,however, is too wavering in his philosophy, vacillating between theprecepts of Zeno and the less worthy maxims of Epicurus, andattempting, as we say, ‘duabus sellis sedere’—concerning suchaccidents, I say, with the pregnant brevity of the poet—</p><p>‘Sunt qui non habeant, est qui non curat habere.’</p><p>“He is referring to gems, and purple, and other insignia of wealth; butI may apply his words not less justly to the tributes men pay us withtheir lips and their pens, which are also matters of purchase, andoften with base coin. Yes, ‘<em>inanis</em>’—hollow, empty—is the epithetjustly bestowed on Fame.”</p><p>They made the tour of the room in silence after this; but Bardo’slip-born maxims were as powerless over the passion which had beenmoving him, as if they had been written on parchment and hung round hisneck in a sealed bag; and he presently broke forth again in a new toneof insistence.</p><p>“<em>Inanis</em>? yes, if it is a lying fame; but not if it is the just meedof labour and a great purpose. I claim my right: it is not fair thatthe work of my brain and my hands should not be a monument to me—it isnot just that my labour should bear the name of another man. It is butlittle to ask,” the old man went on, bitterly, “that my name should beover the door—that men should own themselves debtors to the BardiLibrary in Florence. They will speak coldly of me, perhaps: ‘a diligentcollector and transcriber,’ they will say, ‘and also of some criticalingenuity, but one who could hardly be conspicuous in an age sofruitful in illustrious scholars. Yet he merits our pity, for in thelatter years of his life he was blind, and his only son, to whoseeducation he had devoted his best years—’ Nevertheless, my name will beremembered, and men will honour me: not with the breath of flattery,purchased by mean bribes, but because I have laboured, and because mylabours will remain. Debts! I know there are debts; and there is thydowry, Romola, to be paid. But there must be enough—or, at least, therecan lack but a small sum, such as the Signoria might well provide. Andif Lorenzo had not died, all would have been secured and settled. Butnow...”</p><p>At this moment Maso opened the door, and advancing to his master,announced that Nello, the barber, had desired him to say, that he wascome with the Greek scholar whom he had asked leave to introduce.</p><p>“It is well,” said the old man. “Bring them in.”</p><p>Bardo, conscious that he looked more dependent when he was walking,liked always to be seated in the presence of strangers, and Romola,without needing to be told, conducted him to his chair. She wasstanding by him at her full height, in quiet majestic self-possession,when the visitors entered; and the most penetrating observer wouldhardly have divined that this proud pale face, at the slightest touchon the fibres of affection or pity, could become passionate withtenderness, or that this woman, who imposed a certain awe on those whoapproached her, was in a state of girlish simplicity and ignoranceconcerning the world outside her father’s books.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/CYux/GEreader/tree/main/docs/romola/BOOK I/5_CHAPTER_V.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/GEreader/romola/BOOK I/CHAPTER_IV"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">IV.
