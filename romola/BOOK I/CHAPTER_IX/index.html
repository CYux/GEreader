He was perfectly well aware that that face was Tessa’s; but hehad not chosen to say so. What had Nello to do with the matter? Titohad an innate love of reticence—let us say a talent for it—which actedas other impulses do, without any conscious motive, and, like allpeople to whom concealment is easy, he would now and then concealsomething which had as little the nature of a secret as the fact thathe had seen a flight of crows.</p><p>But the passing wish about pretty Tessa was almost immediately eclipsedby the recurrent recollection of that friar whose face had someirrecoverable association for him. Why should a sickly fanatic, wornwith fasting, have looked at <em>him</em> in particular, and where in all histravels could he remember encountering that face before? Folly! suchvague memories hang about the mind like cobwebs, with ticklingimportunity—best to sweep them away at a dash: and Tito had pleasanteroccupation for his thoughts. By the time he was turning out of theCorso degli Adimari into a side-street he was caring only that the sunwas high, and that the procession had kept him longer than he hadintended from his visit to that room in the Via de’ Bardi, where hiscoming, he knew, was anxiously awaited. He felt the scene of hisentrance beforehand: the joy beaming diffusedly in the blind face likethe light in a semi-transparent lamp; the transient pink flush onRomola’s face and neck, which subtracted nothing from her majesty, butonly gave it the exquisite charm of womanly sensitiveness, heightenedstill more by what seemed the paradoxical boy-like frankness of herlook and smile. They were the best comrades in the world during thehours they passed together round the blind man’s chair: she wasconstantly appealing to Tito, and he was informing her, yet he felthimself strangely in subjection to Romola with that simplicity of hers:he felt for the first time, without defining it to himself, that lovingawe in the presence of noble womanhood, which is perhaps something likethe worship paid of old to a great nature-goddess, who was notall-knowing, but whose life and power were something deeper and moreprimordial than knowledge. They had never been alone together, and hecould frame to himself no probable image of love-scenes between them:he could only fancy and wish wildly—what he knew was impossible—thatRomola would some day tell him that she loved him. One day in Greece,as he was leaning over a wall in the sunshine, a little black-eyedpeasant girl, who had rested her water-pot on the wall, crept graduallynearer and nearer to him, and at last shyly asked him to kiss her,putting up her round olive cheek very innocently. Tito was used to lovethat came in this unsought fashion. But Romola’s love would never comein that way: would it ever come at all?—and yet it was that topmostapple on which he had set his mind. He was in his fresh youth—notpassionate, but impressible: it was as inevitable that he should feellovingly towards Romola as that the white irises should be reflected inthe clear sunlit stream; but he had no coxcombry, and he had anintimate sense that Romola was something very much above him. Many menhave felt the same before a large-eyed, simple child.</p><p>Nevertheless, Tito had had the rapid success which would have made somemen presuming, or would have warranted him in thinking that there wouldbe no great presumption in entertaining an agreeable confidence that hemight one day be the husband of Romola—nay, that her father himself wasnot without a vision of such a future for him. His first auspiciousinterview with Bartolommeo Scala had proved the commencement of agrowing favour on the secretary’s part, and had led to an issue whichwould have been enough to make Tito decide on Florence as the place inwhich to establish himself, even if it had held no other magnet.Politian was professor of Greek as well as Latin at Florence,professorial chairs being maintained there, although the university hadbeen removed to Pisa; but for a long time Demetrio Calcondila, one ofthe most eminent and respectable among the emigrant Greeks, had alsoheld a Greek chair, simultaneously with the too predominant Italian.Calcondila was now gone to Milan, and there was no counterpoise orrival to Politian such as was desired for him by the friends who wishedhim to be taught a little propriety and humility. Scala was far frombeing the only friend of this class, and he found several who, if theywere not among those thirsty admirers of mediocrity that were glad tobe refreshed with his verses in hot weather, were yet quite willing tojoin him in doing that moral service to Politian. It was finally agreedthat Tito should be supported in a Greek chair, as Demetrio Calcondilahad been by Lorenzo himself, who, being at the same time theaffectionate patron of Politian, had shown by precedent that there wasnothing invidious in such a measure, but only a zeal for true learningand for the instruction of the Florentine youth.</p><p>Tito was thus sailing under the fairest breeze, and besides convincingfair judges that his talents squared with his good fortune, he worethat fortune so easily and unpretentiously that no one had yet beenoffended by it. He was not unlikely to get into the best Florentinesociety: society where there was much more plate than the circle ofenamelled silver in the centre of the brass dishes, and where it wasnot forbidden by the Signory to wear the richest brocade. For wherecould a handsome young scholar not be welcome when he could touch thelute and troll a gay song? That bright face, that easy smile, thatliquid voice, seemed to give life a holiday aspect; just as a strain ofgay music and the hoisting of colours make the work-worn and the sadrather ashamed of showing themselves. Here was a professor likely torender the Greek classics amiable to the sons of great houses.</p><p>And that was not the whole of Tito’s good fortune; for he had sold allhis jewels, except the ring he did not choose to part with, and he wasmaster of full five hundred gold florins.</p><p>Yet the moment when he first had this sum in his possession was thecrisis of the first serious struggle his facile, good-humoured naturehad known. An importunate thought, of which he had till now refused tosee more than the shadow as it dogged his footsteps, at last rushedupon him and grasped him: he was obliged to pause and decide whether hewould surrender and obey, or whether he would give the refusal thatmust carry irrevocable consequences. It was in the room above Nello’sshop, which Tito had now hired as a lodging, that the elder Cenninihanded him the last quota of the sum on behalf of Bernardo Rucellai,the purchaser of the two most valuable gems.</p><p>“<em>Ecco, giovane mio</em>!” said the respectable printer and goldsmith, “youhave now a pretty little fortune; and if you will take my advice, youwill let me place your florins in a safe quarter, where they mayincrease and multiply, instead of slipping through your fingers forbanquets and other follies which are rife among our Florentine youth.And it has been too much the fashion of scholars, especially when, likeour Pietro Crinito, they think their scholarship needs to be scentedand broidered, to squander with one hand till they have been fain tobeg with the other. I have brought you the money, and you are free tomake a wise choice or an unwise: I shall see on which side the balancedips. We Florentines hold no man a member of an Art till he has shownhis skill and been matriculated; and no man is matriculated to the artof life till he has been well tempted. If you make up your mind to putyour florins out to usury, you can let me know to-morrow. A scholar maymarry, and should have something in readiness for the <em>morgen-cap.Addio</em>.”<!-- -->[1]</p><p>[1]<!-- --> A sum given by the bridegroom to the bride the day after themarriage. <em>Morgengabe</em>.</p><p>As Cennini closed the door behind him, Tito turned round with the smiledying out of his face, and fixed his eyes on the table where theflorins lay. He made no other movement, but stood with his thumbs inhis belt, looking down, in that transfixed state which accompanies theconcentration of consciousness on some inward image.</p><p>“A man’s ransom!”—who was it that had said five hundred florins wasmore than a man’s ransom? If now, under this mid-day sun, on some hotcoast far away, a man somewhat stricken in years—a man not without highthoughts and with the most passionate heart—a man who long years agohad rescued a little boy from a life of beggary, filth, and cruelwrong, had reared him tenderly, and been to him as a father—if that man<em>were</em> now under this summer sun toiling as a slave, hewing wood anddrawing water, perhaps being smitten and buffeted because he was notdeft and active? If he were saying to himself, “Tito will find me: hehad but to carry our manuscripts and gems to Venice; he will haveraised money, and will never rest till he finds me out”? If that werecertain, could he, Tito, see the price of the gems lying before him,and say, “I will stay at Florence, where I am fanned by soft airs ofpromised love and prosperity; I will not risk myself for his sake”? No,surely not, <em>if it were certain</em>. But nothing could be farther fromcertainty. The galley had been taken by a Turkish vessel on its way toDelos: <em>that</em> was known by the report of the companion galley, whichhad escaped. But there had been resistance, and probable bloodshed; aman had been seen falling overboard: who were the survivors, and whathad befallen them amongst all the multitude of possibilities? Had nothe, Tito, suffered shipwreck, and narrowly escaped drowning? He hadgood cause for feeling the omnipresence of casualties that threatenedall projects with futility. The rumour that there were pirates who hada settlement in Delos was not to be depended on, or might be nothing tothe purpose. What, probably enough, would be the result if he were toquit Florence and go to Venice; get authoritative letters—yes, he knewthat might be done—and set out for the Archipelago? Why, that he shouldbe himself seized, and spend all his florins on preliminaries, and beagain a destitute wanderer—with no more gems to sell.</p><p>Tito had a clearer vision of that result than of the possible momentwhen he might find his father again, and carry him deliverance. Itwould surely be an unfairness that he, in his full ripe youth, to whomlife had hitherto had some of the stint and subjection of a school,should turn his back on promised love and distinction, and perhapsnever be visited by that promise again. “And yet,” he said to himself,“if I were certain that Baldassarre Calvo was alive, and that I couldfree him, by whatever exertions or perils, I would go now—now I havethe money: it was useless to debate the matter before. I would go nowto Bardo and Bartolommeo Scala, and tell them the whole truth.” Titodid not say to himself so distinctly that if those two men had knownthe whole truth he was aware there would have been no alternative forhim but to go in search of his benefactor, who, if alive, was therightful owner of the gems, and whom he had always equivocally spokenof as “lost;” he did not say to himself—what he was not ignorantof—that Greeks of distinction had made sacrifices, taken voyages againand again, and sought help from crowned and mitred heads for the sakeof freeing relatives from slavery to the Turks. Public opinion did notregard this as exceptional virtue.</p><p>This was his first real colloquy with himself: he had gone on followingthe impulses of the moment, and one of those impulses had been toconceal half the fact; he had never considered this part of his conductlong enough to face the consciousness of his motives for theconcealment. What was the use of telling the whole? It was true, thethought had crossed his mind several times since he had quitted Naupliathat, after all, it was a great relief to be quit of Baldassarre, andhe would have liked to know <em>who</em> it was that had fallen overboard. Butsuch thoughts spring inevitably out of a relation that is irksome.Baldassarre was exacting, and had got stranger as he got older: he wasconstantly scrutinising Tito’s mind to see whether it answered to hisown exaggerated expectations; and age—the age of a thickset,heavy-browed, bald man beyond sixty, whose intensity and eagerness inthe grasp of ideas have long taken the character of monotony andrepetition, may be looked at from many points of view without beingfound attractive. Such a man, stranded among new acquaintances, unlesshe had the philosopher’s stone, would hardly find rank, youth, andbeauty at his feet. The feelings that gather fervour from novelty willbe of little help towards making the world a home for dimmed and fadedhuman beings; and if there is any love of which they are not widowed,it must be the love that is rooted in memories and distils perpetuallythe sweet balms of fidelity and forbearing tenderness.</p><p>But surely such memories were not absent from Tito’s mind? Far in thebackward vista of his remembered life, when he was only seven yearsold, Baldassarre had rescued him from blows, had taken him to a homethat seemed like opened paradise, where there was sweet food andsoothing caresses, all had on Baldassarre’s knee; and from that timetill the hour they had parted, Tito had been the one centre ofBaldassarre’s fatherly cares.</p><p>And he had been docile, pliable, quick of apprehension, ready toacquire: a very bright lovely boy, a youth of even splendid grace, whoseemed quite without vices, as if that beautiful form represented avitality so exquisitely poised and balanced that it could know nouneasy desires, no unrest—a radiant presence for a lonely man to havewon for himself. If he were silent when his father expected someresponse, still he did not look moody; if he declined some labour—why,he flung himself down with such a charming, half-smiling, half-pleadingair, that the pleasure of looking at him made amends to one who hadwatched his growth with a sense of claim and possession: the curves ofTito’s mouth had ineffable good-humour in them. And then, the quicktalent to which everything came readily, from philosophical systems tothe rhymes of a street ballad caught up at a hearing! Would any onehave said that Tito had not made a rich return to his benefactor, orthat his gratitude and affection would fail on any great demand?</p><p>He did not admit that his gratitude had failed; but <em>it was notcertain</em> that Baldassarre was in slavery, not certain that he wasliving.</p><p>“Do I not owe something to myself?” said Tito, inwardly, with a slightmovement of his shoulders, the first he had made since he had turned tolook down at the florins. “Before I quit everything, and incur againall the risks of which I am even now weary, I must at least have areasonable hope. Am I to spend my life in a wandering search? <em>Ibelieve he is dead</em>. Cennini was right about my florins: I will placethem in his hands to-morrow.”</p><p>When, the next morning, Tito put this determination into act he hadchosen his colour in the game, and had given an inevitable bent to hiswishes. He had made it impossible that he should not from henceforthdesire it to be the truth that his father was dead; impossible that heshould not be tempted to baseness rather than that the precise facts ofhis conduct should not remain for ever concealed.</p><p>Under every guilty secret there is hidden a brood of guilty wishes,whose unwholesome infecting life is cherished by the darkness. Thecontaminating effect of deeds often lies less in the commission than inthe consequent adjustment of our desires—the enlistment of ourself-interest on the side of falsity; as, on the other hand, thepurifying influence of public confession springs from the fact, that byit the hope in lies is for ever swept away, and the soul recovers thenoble attitude of simplicity.</p><p>Besides, in this first distinct colloquy with himself the ideas whichhad previously been scattered and interrupted had now concentratedthemselves; the little rills of selfishness had united and made achannel, so that they could never again meet with the same resistance.Hitherto Tito had left in vague indecision the question whether, withthe means in his power, he would not return, and ascertain his father’sfate; he had now made a definite excuse to himself for not taking thatcourse; he had avowed to himself a choice which he would have beenashamed to avow to others, and which would have made him ashamed in theresurgent presence of his father. But the inward shame, the reflex ofthat outward law which the great heart of mankind makes for everyindividual man, a reflex which will exist even in the absence of thesympathetic impulses that need no law, but rush to the deed of fidelityand pity as inevitably as the brute mother shields her young from theattack of the hereditary enemy—that inward shame was showing itsblushes in Tito’s determined assertion to himself that his father wasdead, or that at least search was hopeless.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/CYux/GEreader/tree/main/docs/romola/BOOK I/9_CHAPTER_IX.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/GEreader/romola/BOOK I/CHAPTER_VIII"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">VIII.
