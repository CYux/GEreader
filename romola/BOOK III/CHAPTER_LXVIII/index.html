In this chapter, Romola is found adrift in a boat after escaping from Florence. She wakes up in a secluded creek, where she hears a child crying. Upon investigation, she discovers a scene of death and pestilence. A family of Jewish refugees has been struck by the plague, leaving only a small child alive. Romola takes the child and seeks help from the nearby village. However, the villagers are also suffering from the plague and many have fled. Romola finds a priest and a young boy, Jacopo, who are fearful of the disease. She convinces them to help her care for the sick and bury the dead. Over time, the village recovers, and Romola becomes a beloved figure. She eventually grows weak and weary, but continues to care for the child, Benedetto, and the villagers.</p><p><strong>Main Characters</strong>:

Her eyes opened and shesaw it was the light of morning. Her boat was lying still in a littlecreek; on her right-hand lay the speckless sapphire-blue of theMediterranean; on her left one of those scenes which were and still arerepeated again and again like a sweet rhythm, on the shores of thatloveliest sea.</p><p>In a deep curve of the mountains lay a breadth of green land, curtainedby gentle tree-shadowed slopes leaning towards the rocky heights. Upthese slopes might be seen here and there, gleaming between thetree-tops, a pathway leading to a little irregular mass of buildingthat seemed to have clambered in a hasty way up the mountain-side, andtaken a difficult stand there for the sake of showing the tall belfryas a sight of beauty to the scattered and clustered houses of thevillage below. The rays of the newly-risen sun fell obliquely on thewestward horn of this crescent-shaped nook: all else lay in dewyshadow. No sound came across the stillness; the very waters seemed tohave curved themselves there for rest.</p><p>The delicious sun-rays fell on Romola and thrilled her gently like acaress. She lay motionless, hardly watching the scene; rather, feelingsimply the presence of peace and beauty. While we are still in ouryouth there can always come, in our early waking, moments when merepassive existence is itself a Lethe, when the exquisiteness of subtleindefinite sensation creates a bliss which is without memory andwithout desire. As the soft warmth penetrated Romola’s young limbs, asher eyes rested on this sequestered luxuriance, it seemed that theagitating past had glided away like that dark scene in the Bargello,and that the afternoon dreams of her girlhood had really come back toher. For a minute or two the oblivion was untroubled; she did not eventhink that she could rest here for ever, she only felt that she rested.Then she became distinctly conscious that she was lying in the boatwhich had been bearing her over the waters all through the night.Instead of bringing her to death, it had been the gently lulling cradleof a new life. And in spite of her evening despair she was glad thatthe morning had come to her again: glad to think that she was restingin the familiar sunlight rather than in the unknown regions of death.<em>Could</em> she not rest here? No sound from Florence would reach her.Already oblivion was troubled; from behind the golden haze werepiercing domes and towers and walls, parted by a river and enclosed bythe green hills.</p><p>She rose from her reclining posture and sat up in the boat, willing, ifshe could, to resist the rush of thoughts that urged themselves alongwith the conjecture how far the boat had carried her. Why need shemind? This was a sheltered nook where there were simple villagers whowould not harm her. For a little while, at least, she might rest andresolve on nothing. Presently she would go and get some bread and milk,and then she would nestle in the green quiet, and feel that there was apause in her life. She turned to watch the crescent-shaped valley, thatshe might get back the soothing sense of peace and beauty which she hadfelt in her first waking.</p><p>She had not been in this attitude of contemplation more than a fewminutes when across the stillness there came a piercing cry; not abrief cry, but continuous and more and more intense. Romola felt sureit was the cry of a little child in distress that no one came to help.She started up and put one foot on the side of the boat ready to leapon to the beach; but she paused there and listened: the mother of thechild must be near, the cry must soon cease. But it went on, and drewRomola so irresistibly, seeming the more piteous to her for the senseof peace which had preceded it, that she jumped on to the beach andwalked many paces before she knew what direction she would take. Thecry, she thought, came from some rough garden growth many yards on herright-hand, where she saw a half-ruined hovel. She climbed over a lowbroken stone fence, and made her way across patches of weedy greencrops and ripe but neglected corn. The cry grew plainer, and convincedthat she was right she hastened towards the hovel; but even in thathurried walk she felt an oppressive change in the air as she left thesea behind. Was there some taint lurking amongst the green luxuriancethat had seemed such an inviting shelter from the heat of the comingday? She could see the opening into the hovel now, and the cry wasdarting through her like a pain. The next moment her foot was withinthe doorway, but the sight she beheld in the sombre light arrested herwith a shock of awe and horror. On the straw, with which the floor wasscattered, lay three dead bodies, one of a tall man, one of a girlabout eight years old, and one of a young woman whose long black hairwas being clutched and pulled by a living child—the child that wassending forth the piercing cry. Romola’s experience in the haunts ofdeath and disease made thought and action prompt: she lifted the littleliving child, and in trying to soothe it on her bosom, still sent tolook at the bodies and see if they were really dead. The stronglymarked type of race in their features, and their peculiar garb, madeher conjecture that they were Spanish or Portuguese Jews, who hadperhaps been put ashore and abandoned there by rapacious sailors, towhom their property remained as a prey. Such things were happeningcontinually to Jews compelled to abandon their homes by theInquisition: the cruelty of greed thrust them from the sea, and thecruelty of superstition thrust them back to it.</p><p>“But, surely,” thought Romola, “I shall find some woman in the villagewhose mother’s heart will not let her refuse to tend this helplesschild—if the real mother is indeed dead.”</p><p>This doubt remained, because while the man and girl looked emaciatedand also showed signs of having been long dead, the woman seemed tohave been hardier, and had not quite lost the robustness of her form.Romola, kneeling, was about to lay her hand on the heart; but as shelifted the piece of yellow woollen drapery that lay across the bosom,she saw the purple spots which marked the familiar pestilence. Then itstruck her that if the villagers knew of this, she might have moredifficulty than she had expected in getting help from them; they wouldperhaps shrink from her with that child in her arms. But she had moneyto offer them, and they would not refuse to give her some goat’s milkin exchange for it.</p><p>She set out at once towards the village, her mind filled now with theeffort to soothe the little dark creature, and with wondering how sheshould win some woman to be good to it. She could not help hoping alittle in a certain awe she had observed herself to inspire, when sheappeared, unknown and unexpected, in her religious dress. As she passedacross a breadth of cultivated ground, she noticed, with wonder, thatlittle patches of corn mingled with the other crops had been left toover-ripeness untouched by the sickle, and that golden apples and darkfigs lay rotting on the weedy earth. There were grassy spaces withinsight, but no cow, or sheep, or goat. The stillness began to havesomething fearful in it to Romola; she hurried along towards thethickest cluster of houses, where there would be the most life toappeal to on behalf of the helpless life she carried in her arms. Butshe had picked up two figs, and bit little pieces from the sweet pulpto still the child with.</p><p>She entered between two lines of dwellings. It was time that villagersshould have been stirring long ago, but not a soul was in sight. Theair was becoming more and more oppressive, laden, it seemed, with somehorrible impurity. There was a door open; she looked in, and saw grimemptiness. Another open door; and through that she saw a man lying deadwith all his garments on, his head lying athwart a spade handle, and anearthenware cruse in his hand, as if he had fallen suddenly.</p><p>Romola felt horror taking possession of her. Was she in a village ofthe unburied dead? She wanted to listen if there were any faint sound,but the child cried out afresh when she ceased to feed it, and the cryfilled her ears. At last she saw a figure crawling slowly out of ahouse, and soon sinking back in a sitting posture against the wall. Shehastened towards the figure; it was a young woman in fevered anguish,and she, too, held a pitcher in her hand. As Romola approached her shedid not start; the one need was too absorbing for any other idea toimpress itself on her.</p><p>“Water! get me water!” she said, with a moaning utterance.</p><p>Romola stooped to take the pitcher, and said gently in her ear, “Youshall have water; can you point towards the well?”</p><p>The hand was lifted towards the more distant end of the little street,and Romola set off at once with as much speed as she could use underthe difficulty of carrying the pitcher as well as feeding the child.But the little one was getting more content as the morsels of sweetpulp were repeated, and ceased to distress her with its cry, so thatshe could give a less distracted attention to the objects around her.</p><p>The well lay twenty yards or more beyond the end of the street, and asRomola was approaching it her eyes were directed to the opposite greenslope immediately below the church. High up, on a patch of grassbetween the trees, she had descried a cow and a couple of goats, andshe tried to trace a line of path that would lead her close to thatcheering sight, when once she had done her errand to the well. Occupiedin this way, she was not aware that she was very near the well, andthat some one approaching it on the other side had fixed a pair ofastonished eyes upon her.</p><p>Romola certainly presented a sight which, at, that moment and in thatplace, could hardly have been seen without some pausing andpalpitation. With her gaze fixed intently on the distant slope, thelong lines of her thick grey garment giving a gliding character to herrapid walk, her hair rolling backward and illuminated on the left sideby the sun-rays, the little olive baby on her right arm now looking outwith jet-black eyes, she might well startle that youth of fifteen,accustomed to swing the censer in the presence of a Madonna less fairand marvellous than this.</p><p>“She carries a pitcher in her hand—to fetch water for the sick. It isthe Holy Mother, come to take care of the people who have thepestilence.”</p><p>It was a sight of awe: she would, perhaps, be angry with those whofetched water for themselves only. The youth flung down his vessel interror, and Romola, aware now of some one near her, saw the black andwhite figure fly as if for dear life towards the slope she had justbeen contemplating. But remembering the parched sufferer, shehalf-filled her pitcher quickly and hastened back.</p><p>Entering the house to look for a small cup, she saw salt meat and meal:there were no signs of want in the dwelling. With nimble movement sheseated baby on the ground, and lifted a cup of water to the sufferer,who drank eagerly and then closed her eyes and leaned her headbackward, seeming to give herself up to the sense of relief. Presentlyshe opened her eyes, and, looking at Romola, said languidly—</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>“I came over the sea,” said Romola, “I only came this morning. Are allthe people dead in these houses?”</p><p>“I think they are all ill now—all that are not dead. My father and mysister lie dead upstairs, and there is no one to bury them: and soon Ishall die.”</p><p>“Not so, I hope,” said Romola. “I am come to take care of you. I amused to the pestilence; I am not afraid. But there must be some leftwho are not ill. I saw a youth running towards the mountain when I wentto the well.”</p><p>“I cannot tell. When the pestilence came, a great many people wentaway, and drove off the cows and goats. Give me more water!”</p><p>Romola, suspecting that if she followed the direction of the youth’sflight, she should find some men and women who were still healthy andable, determined to seek them out at once, that she might at least winthem to take care of the child, and leave her free to come back and seehow many living needed help, and how many dead needed burial. Shetrusted to her powers of persuasion to conquer the aid of the timorous,when once she knew what was to be done.</p><p>Promising the sick woman to come back to her, she lifted the darkbantling again, and set off towards the slope. She felt no burden ofchoice on her now, no longing for death. She was thinking how she wouldgo to the other sufferers, as she had gone to that fevered woman.</p><p>But, with the child on her arm, it was not so easy to her as usual towalk up a slope, and it seemed a long while before the winding pathtook her near the cow and the goats. She was beginning herself to feelfaint from heat, hunger, and thirst, and as she reached a doubleturning, she paused to consider whether she would not wait near thecow, which some one was likely to come and milk soon, rather than toilup to the church before she had taken any rest. Raising her eyes tomeasure the steep distance, she saw peeping between the boughs, notmore than five yards off, a broad round face, watching her attentively,and lower down the black skirt of a priest’s garment, and a handgrasping a bucket. She stood mutely observing, and the face, too,remained motionless. Romola had often witnessed the overpowering forceof dread in cases of pestilence, and she was cautious.</p><p>Raising her voice in a tone of gentle pleading, she said, “I came overthe sea. I am hungry, and so is the child. Will you not give us somemilk?”</p><p>Romola had divined part of the truth, but she had not divined thatpreoccupation of the priest’s mind which charged her words with astrange significance. Only a little while ago, the young acolyte hadbrought word to the Padre that he had seen the Holy Mother with theBabe, fetching water for the sick: she was as tall as the cypresses,and had a light about her head, and she looked up at the church. Thepievano (parish priest) had not listened with entire belief: he hadbeen more than fifty years in the world without having any vision ofthe Madonna, and he thought the boy might have misinterpreted theunexpected appearance of a villager. But he had been made uneasy, andbefore venturing to come down and milk his cow, he had repeated manyAves. The pievano’s conscience tormented him a little: he trembled atthe pestilence, but he also trembled at the thought of the mild-facedMother, conscious that that Invisible Mercy might demand something moreof him than prayers and “Hails.” In this state of mind—unable to banishthe image the boy had raised of the Mother with the glory about hertending the sick—the pievano had come down to milk his cow, and hadsuddenly caught sight of Romola pausing at the parted way. Her pleadingwords, with their strange refinement of tone and accent, instead ofbeing explanatory, had a preternatural sound for him. Yet he did notquite believe he saw the Holy Mother: he was in a state of alarmedhesitation. If anything miraculous were happening, he felt there was nostrong presumption that the miracle would be in his favour. He darednot run away; he dared not advance.</p><p>“Come down,” said Romola, after a pause. “Do not fear. Fear rather todeny food to the hungry when they ask you.”</p><p>A moment after, the boughs were parted, and the complete figure of athickset priest with a broad, harmless face, his black frock much wornand soiled, stood, bucket in hand, looking at her timidly, and stillkeeping aloof as he took the path towards the cow in silence.</p><p>Romola followed him and watched him without speaking again, as heseated himself against the tethered cow, and, when he had nervouslydrawn some milk, gave it to her in a brass cup he carried with him inthe bucket. As Romola put the cup to the lips of the eager child, andafterwards drank some milk herself, the Padre observed her from hiswooden stool with a timidity that changed its character a little. Herecognised the Hebrew baby, he was certain that he had a substantialwoman before him; but there was still something strange andunaccountable in Romola’s presence in this spot, and the Padre had apresentiment that things were going to change with him. Moreover, thatHebrew baby was terribly associated with the dread of pestilence.</p><p>Nevertheless, when Romola smiled at the little one sucking its ownmilky lips, and stretched out the brass cup again, saying, “Give usmore, good father,” he obeyed less nervously than before.</p><p>Romola on her side was not unobservant; and when the second supply ofmilk had been drunk, she looked down at the round-headed man, and saidwith mild decision—</p><p>“And now tell me, father, how this pestilence came, and why you letyour people die without the sacraments; and lie unburied. For I am comeover the sea to help those who are left alive—and you, too, will helpthem now.”</p><p>He told her the story of the pestilence: and while he was telling it,the youth, who had fled before, had come peeping and advancinggradually, till at last he stood and watched the scene from behind aneighbouring bush.</p><p>Three families of Jews, twenty souls in all, had been put ashore manyweeks ago, some of them already ill of the pestilence. The villagers,said the priest, had of course refused to give shelter to themiscreants, otherwise than in a distant hovel, and under heaps ofstraw. But when the strangers had died of the plague, and some of thepeople had thrown the bodies into the sea, the sea had brought themback again in a great storm, and everybody was smitten with terror. Agrave was dug, and the bodies were buried; but then the pestilenceattacked the Christians, and the greater number of the villagers wentaway over the mountain, driving away their few cattle, and carryingprovisions. The priest had not fled; he had stayed and prayed for thepeople, and he had prevailed on the youth Jacopo to stay with him; buthe confessed that a mortal terror of the plague had taken hold of him,and he had not dared to go down into the valley.</p><p>“You will fear no longer, father,” said Romola, in a tone ofencouraging authority; “you will come down with me, and we will see whois living, and we will look for the dead to bury them. I have walkedabout for months where the pestilence was, and see, I am strong. Jacopowill come with us,” she added, motioning to the peeping lad, who cameslowly from behind his defensive bush, as if invisible threads weredragging him.</p><p>“Come, Jacopo,” said Romola again, smiling at him, “you will carry thechild for me. See! your arms are strong, and I am tired.”</p><p>That was a dreadful proposal to Jacopo, and to the priest also; butthey were both under a peculiar influence forcing them to obey. Thesuspicion that Romola was a supernatural form was dissipated, but theirminds were filled instead with the more effective sense that she was ahuman being whom God had sent over the sea to command them.</p><p>“Now we will carry down the milk,” said Romola, “and see if any onewants it.”</p><p>So they went all together down the slope, and that morning thesufferers saw help come to them in their despair. There were hardlymore than a score alive in the whole valley; but all of these werecomforted, most were saved, and the dead were buried.</p><p>In this way days, weeks, and months passed with Romola till the menwere digging and sowing again, till the women smiled at her as theycarried their great vases on their heads to the well, and the Hebrewbaby was a tottering tumbling Christian, Benedetto by name, having beenbaptised in the church on the mountain-side. But by that time sheherself was suffering from the fatigue and languor that must come aftera continuous strain on mind and body. She had taken for her dwellingone of the houses abandoned by their owners, standing a little alooffrom the village street; and here on a thick heap of clean straw—adelicious bed for those who do not dream of down—she felt glad to liestill through most of the daylight hours, taken care of along with thelittle Benedetto by a woman whom the pestilence had widowed.</p><p>Every day the Padre and Jacopo and the small flock of survivingvillagers paid their visit to this cottage to see the blessed Lady, andto bring her of their best as an offering—honey, fresh cakes, eggs, andpolenta. It was a sight they could none of them forget, a sight theyall told of in their old age—how the sweet and sainted lady with herfair face, her golden hair, and her brown eyes that had a blessing inthem, lay weary with her labours after she had been sent over the seato help them in their extremity, and how the queer little blackBenedetto used to crawl about the straw by her side and want everythingthat was brought to her, and she always gave him a bit of what shetook, and told them if they loved her they must be good to Benedetto.</p><p>Many legends were afterwards told in that valley about the blessed Ladywho came over the sea, but they were legends by which all who heardmight know that in times gone by a woman had done beautiful lovingdeeds there, rescuing those who were ready to perish.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/CYux/GEreader/tree/main/docs/romola/BOOK III/68_CHAPTER_LXVIII.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/GEreader/romola/BOOK III/CHAPTER_LXVII"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">LXVII.
