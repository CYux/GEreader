Not ahand’s-breadth of pavement was to be seen, but only the heads of aneager struggling multitude. And instead of that background of silencein which the pattering footsteps and buzzing voices, the lute-thrummingor rapid scampering of the many night wanderers of Florence stood outin obtrusive distinctness, there was the background of a roar frommingled shouts and imprecations, tramplings and pushings, andaccidental clashing of weapons, across which nothing wasdistinguishable but a darting shriek, or the heavy dropping toll of abell.</p><p>Almost all who could call themselves the public of Florence were awakeat that hour, and either enclosed within the limits of that piazza, orstruggling to enter it. Within the palace were still assembled in thecouncil-chamber all the chief magistracies, the eighty members of thesenate, and the other select citizens who had been in hot debatethrough long hours of daylight and torchlight whether the Appeal shouldbe granted or whether the sentence of death should be executed on theprisoners forthwith, to forestall the dangerous chances of delay. Andthe debate had been so much like fierce quarrel that the noise from thecouncil-chamber had reached the crowd outside. Only within the lasthour had the question been decided: the Signoria had remained divided,four of them standing out resolutely for the Appeal in spite of thestrong argument that if they did not give way their houses should besacked, until Francesco Valori, in brief and furious speech, made thedetermination of his party more ominously distinct by declaring that ifthe Signoria would not defend the liberties of the Florentine people byexecuting those five perfidious citizens, there would not be wantingothers who would take that cause in hand to the peril of all whoopposed it. The Florentine Cato triumphed. When the votes were countedagain, the four obstinate white beans no longer appeared; the wholenine were of the fatal affirmative black, deciding the death of thefive prisoners without delay—deciding also, only tacitly and with muchmore delay, the death of Francesco Valori.</p><p>And now, while the judicial Eight were gone to the Bargello to preparefor the execution, the five condemned men were being led barefoot andin irons through the midst of the council. It was their friends who hadcontrived this: would not Florentines be moved by the visibleassociation of such cruel ignominy with two venerable men like Bernardodel Nero and Niccolò Ridolfi, who had taken their bias long before thenew order of things had come to make Mediceanism retrograde—with twobrilliant popular young men like Tornabuoni and Pucci, whose absencewould be felt as a haunting vacancy wherever there was a meeting ofchief Florentines? It was useless: such pity as could be awakened nowwas of that hopeless sort which leads not to rescue, but to the tardieraction of revenge.</p><p>While this scene was passing upstairs Romola stood below against one ofthe massive pillars in the court of the palace, expecting the momentwhen her godfather would appear, on his way to execution. By the use ofstrong interest she had gained permission to visit him in the eveningof this day, and remain with him until the result of the council shouldbe determined. And now she was waiting with his confessor to follow theguard that would lead him to the Bargello. Her heart was bent onclinging to the presence of the childless old man to the last moment,as her father would have done; and she had overpowered allremonstrances. Giovan Battista Ridolfi, a disciple of Savonarola, whowas going in bitterness to behold the death of his elder brotherNiccolò, had promised that she should be guarded, and now stood by herside.</p><p>Tito, too, was in the palace; but Romola had not seen him. Since theevening of the seventeenth they had avoided each other, and Tito onlyknew by inference from the report of the Frate’s neutrality that herpleading had failed. He was now surrounded with official and otherpersonages, both Florentine and foreign, who had been awaiting theissue of the long-protracted council, maintaining, except when he wasdirectly addressed, the subdued air and grave silence of a man whomactual events are placing in a painful state of strife between publicand private feeling. When an allusion was made to his wife in relationto those events, he implied that, owing to the violent excitement ofher mind, the mere fact of his continuing to hold office under agovernment concerned in her godfather’s condemnation, roused in her adiseased hostility towards him; so that for her sake he felt it bestnot to approach her.</p><p>“Ah, the old Bardi blood!” said Cennini, with a shrug. “I shall not besurprised if this business shakes <em>her</em> loose from the Frate, as wellas some others I could name.”</p><p>“It is excusable in a woman, who is doubtless beautiful, since she isthe wife of Messer Tito,” said a young French envoy, smiling and bowingto Tito, “to think that her affections must overrule the good of theState, and that nobody is to be beheaded who is anybody’s cousin; butsuch a view is not to be encouraged in the male population. It seems tome your Florentine polity is much weakened by it.”</p><p>“That is true,” said Niccolò Macchiavelli; “but where personal ties arestrong, the hostilities they raise must be taken due account of. Manyof these half-way severities are mere hot-headed blundering. The onlysafe blows to be inflicted on men and parties are the blows that aretoo heavy to be avenged.”</p><p>“Niccolò,” said Cennini, “there is a clever wickedness in thy talksometimes that makes me mistrust thy pleasant young face as if it werea mask of Satan.”</p><p>“Not at all, my good Domenico,” said Macchiavelli, smiling, and layinghis hand on the elder’s shoulder. “Satan was a blunderer, an introducerof <em>novita</em>, who made a stupendous failure. If he had succeeded, weshould all have been worshipping him, and his portrait would have beenmore flattered.”</p><p>“Well, well,” said Cennini, “I say not thy doctrine is not too cleverfor Satan: I only say it is wicked enough for him.”</p><p>“I tell you,” said Macchiavelli, “my doctrine is the doctrine of allmen who seek an end a little farther off than their own noses. Ask ourFrate, our prophet, how his universal renovation is to be broughtabout: he will tell you, first, by getting a free and pure government;and since it appears that this cannot be done by making all Florentineslove each other, it must be done by cutting off every head that happensto be obstinately in the way. Only if a man incurs odium by sanctioninga severity that is not thorough enough to be final, he commits ablunder. And something like that blunder, I suspect, the Frate hascommitted. It was an occasion on which he might have won some lustre byexerting himself to maintain the Appeal; instead of that, he has lostlustre, and has gained no strength.”</p><p>Before any one else could speak, there came the expected announcementthat the prisoners were about to leave the council-chamber; and themajority of those who were present hurried towards the door, intent onsecuring the freest passage to the Bargello in the rear of theprisoners’ guard; for the scene of the execution was one that drewalike those who were moved by the deepest passions and those who weremoved by the coldest curiosity.</p><p>Tito was one of those who remained behind. He had a native repugnanceto sights of death and pain, and five days ago whenever he had thoughtof this execution as a possibility he had hoped that it would not takeplace, and that the utmost sentence would be exile: his own safetydemanded no more. But now he felt that it would be a welcome guaranteeof his security when he had learned that Bernardo del Nero’s head wasoff the shoulders. The new knowledge and new attitude towards himdisclosed by Romola on the day of his return, had given him a new dreadof the power she possessed to make his position insecure. If any act ofhers only succeeded in making him an object of suspicion and odium, heforesaw not only frustration, but frustration under unpleasantcircumstances. Her belief in Baldassarre had clearly determined herwavering feelings against further submission, and if her godfatherlived she would win him to share her belief without much trouble.Romola seemed more than ever an unmanageable fact in his destiny. Butif Bernardo del Nero were dead, the difficulties that would beset herin placing herself in opposition to her husband would probably beinsurmountable to her shrinking pride. Therefore Tito had felt easierwhen he knew that the Eight had gone to the Bargello to order theinstant erection of the scaffold. Four other men—his intimates andconfederates—were to die, besides Bernardo del Nero. But a man’s ownsafety is a god that sometimes makes very grim demands. Tito felt themto be grim: even in the pursuit of what was agreeable, this paradoxicallife forced upon him the desire for what was disagreeable. But he hadhad other experience of this sort, and as he heard through the opendoorway the shuffle of many feet and the clanking of metal on thestairs, he was able to answer the questions of the young French envoywithout showing signs of any other feeling than that of sad resignationto State necessities.</p><p>Those sounds fell on Romola as if her power of hearing had been exaltedalong with every other sensibility of her nature. She needed no arm tosupport her; she shed no tears. She felt that intensity of life whichseems to transcend both grief and joy—in which the mind seems to itselfakin to elder forces that wrought out existence before the birth ofpleasure and pain. Since her godfather’s fate had been decided, theprevious struggle of feeling in her had given way to an identificationof herself with him in these supreme moments: she was inwardlyasserting for him that, if he suffered the punishment of treason, hedid not deserve the name of traitor; he was the victim to a collisionbetween two kinds of faithfulness. It was not given him to die for thenoblest cause, and yet he died because of his nobleness. He might havebeen a meaner man and found it easier not to incur this guilt. Romolawas feeling the full force of that sympathy with the individual lotthat is continually opposing itself to the formulae by which actionsand parties are judged. She was treading the way with her second fatherto the scaffold, and nerving herself to defy ignominy by theconsciousness that it was not deserved.</p><p>The way was fenced in by three hundred armed men, who had been placedas a guard by the orders of Francesco Valori, for among the apparentcontradictions that belonged to this event, not the least striking wasthe alleged alarm on the one hand at the popular rage against theconspirators, and the alleged alarm on the other lest there should bean attempt to rescue them in the midst of a hostile crowd. When theyhad arrived within the court of the Bargello, Romola was allowed toapproach Bernardo with his confessor for a moment of farewell. Manyeyes were bent on them even in that struggle of an agitated throng, asthe aged man, forgetting that his hands were bound with irons, liftedthem towards the golden head that was bent towards him, and then,checking that movement, leaned to kiss her. She seized the fetteredhands that were hung down again, and kissed them as if they had beensacred things.</p><p>“My poor Romola,” said Bernardo, in a low voice, “I have only to die,but thou hast to live—and I shall not be there to help thee.”</p><p>“Yes,” said Romola, hurriedly, “you <em>will</em> help me—always—because Ishall remember you.”</p><p>She was taken away and conducted up the flight of steps that led to theloggia surrounding the grand old court. She took her place there,determined to look till the moment when her godfather laid his head onthe block. Now while the prisoners were allowed a brief interval withtheir confessor, the spectators were pressing into court until thecrowd became dense around the black scaffold, and the torches fixed iniron rings against the pillars threw a varying startling light at onemoment on passionless stone carvings, at another on some pale faceagitated with suppressed rage or suppressed grief—the face of one amongthe many near relatives of the condemned, who were presently to receivetheir dead and carry them home.</p><p>Romola’s face looked like a marble image against the dark arch as shestood watching for the moment when her godfather would appear at thefoot of the scaffold. He was to suffer first, and Battista Ridolfi, whowas by her side, had promised to take her away through a door behindthem when she would have seen the last look of the man who alone in allthe world had shared her pitying love for her father. And still, in thebackground of her thought, there was the possibility striving to be ahope, that some rescue might yet come, something that would keep thatscaffold unstained by blood.</p><p>For a long while there was constant movement, lights flickering, headsswaying to and fro, confused voices within the court, rushing waves ofsound through the entrance from without. It seemed to Romola as if shewere in the midst of a storm-troubled sea, caring nothing about thestorm, caring only to hold out a signal till the eyes that looked forit could seek it no more.</p><p>Suddenly there was stillness, and the very tapers seemed to trembleinto quiet. The executioner was ready on the scaffold, and Bernardo delNero was seen ascending it with a slow firm step. Romola made novisible movement, uttered not even a suppressed sound: she stood morefirmly, caring for <em>his</em> firmness. She saw him pause, saw the whitehead kept erect, while he said, in a voice distinctly audible—</p><p>“It is but a short space of life that my fellow-citizens have takenfrom me.”</p><p>She perceived that he was gazing slowly round him as he spoke. She feltthat his eyes were resting on her, and that she was stretching out herarms towards him. Then she saw no more till—a long while after, as itseemed—a voice said, “My daughter, all is peace now. I can conduct youto your house.”</p><p>She uncovered her head and saw her godfather’s confessor standing byher, in a room where there were other grave men talking in subduedtones.</p><p>“I am ready,” she said, starting up. “Let us lose no time.”</p><p>She thought all clinging was at an end for her: all her strength nowshould be given to escape from a grasp under which she shuddered.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/CYux/GEreader/tree/main/docs/romola/BOOK III/60_CHAPTER_LX.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/GEreader/romola/BOOK III/CHAPTER_LIX"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">LIX.
