This chapter provides setting details and historical context for the novel that takes place in 15th century Italy. The narrative opens with a lyrical discourse on the sameness of human life over centuries, shared human experiences, natural and human-made landscapes, politics, religion, and various aspects of human condition. Thrust into the complexities of an evolving historical reality, the story unfolds in the city of Florence, just before the era of the Renaissance. The chapter shares the contemplative monologue of a &#x27;resuscitated spirit&#x27;, a man who lived during the time of Columbus, and his experiences and observations of the Florence city and its society.</p><p><strong>Main Characters</strong>:

And as the faint light of his coursepierced into the dwellings of men, it fell, as now, on the rosy warmthof nestling children; on the haggard waking of sorrow and sickness; onthe hasty uprising of the hard-handed labourer; and on the late sleepof the night-student, who had been questioning the stars or the sages,or his own soul, for that hidden knowledge which would break throughthe barrier of man’s brief life, and show its dark path, that seemed tobend no whither, to be an arc in an immeasurable circle of light andglory. The great river-courses which have shaped the lives of men havehardly changed; and those other streams, the life-currents that ebb andflow in human hearts, pulsate to the same great needs, the same greatloves and terrors. As our thought follows close in the slow wake of thedawn, we are impressed with the broad sameness of the human lot, whichnever alters in the main headings of its history—hunger and labour,seed-time and harvest, love and death.</p><p>Even if, instead of following the dim daybreak, our imagination pauseson a certain historical spot and awaits the fuller morning, we may seea world-famous city, which has hardly changed its outline since thedays of Columbus, seeming to stand as an almost unviolated symbol,amidst the flux of human things, to remind us that we still resemblethe men of the past more than we differ from them, as the greatmechanical principles on which those domes and towers were raised mustmake a likeness in human building that will be broader and deeper thanall possible change. And doubtless, if the spirit of a Florentinecitizen, whose eyes were closed for the last time while Columbus wasstill waiting and arguing for the three poor vessels with which he wasto set sail from the port of Palos, could return from the shades andpause where our thought is pausing, he would believe that there muststill be fellowship and understanding for him among the inheritors ofhis birthplace.</p><p>Let us suppose that such a Shade has been permitted to revisit theglimpses of the golden morning, and is standing once more on the famoushill of San Miniato, which overlooks Florence from the south.</p><p>The Spirit is clothed in his habit as he lived: the folds of hiswell-lined black silk garment or <em>lucco</em> hang in grave unbroken linesfrom neck to ankle; his plain cloth cap, with its <em>becchetto</em>, or longhanging strip of drapery, to serve as a scarf in case of need,surmounts a penetrating face, not, perhaps, very handsome, but with afirm, well-cut mouth, kept distinctly human by a close-shaven lip andchin. It is a face charged with memories of a keen and various lifepassed below there on the banks of the gleaming river; and as he looksat the scene before him, the sense of familiarity is so much strongerthan the perception of change, that he thinks it might be possible todescend once more amongst the streets, and take up that busy life wherehe left it. For it is not only the mountains and the westward-bendingriver that he recognises; not only the dark sides of Mount Morelloopposite to him, and the long valley of the Arno that seems to stretchits grey low-tufted luxuriance to the far-off ridges of Carrara; andthe steep height of Fiesole, with its crown of monastic walls andcypresses; and all the green and grey slopes sprinkled with villaswhich he can name as he looks at them. He sees other familiar objectsmuch closer to his daily walks. For though he misses the seventy ormore towers that once surmounted the walls, and encircled the city aswith a regal diadem, his eyes will not dwell on that blank; they aredrawn irresistibly to the unique tower springing, like a tallflower-stem drawn towards the sun, from the square turreted mass of theOld Palace in the very heart of the city—the tower that looks none theworse for the four centuries that have passed since he used to walkunder it. The great dome, too, greatest in the world, which, in hisearly boyhood, had been only a daring thought in the mind of a small,quick-eyed man—there it raises its large curves still, eclipsing thehills. And the well-known bell-towers—Giotto’s, with its distant hintof rich colour, and the graceful-spired Badia, and the rest—he lookedat them all from the shoulder of his nurse.</p><p>“Surely,” he thinks, “Florence can still ring her bells with the solemnhammer-sound that used to beat on the hearts of her citizens and strikeout the fire there. And here, on the right, stands the long dark massof Santa Croce, where we buried our famous dead, laying the laurel ontheir cold brows and fanning them with the breath of praise and ofbanners. But Santa Croce had no spire then: we Florentines were toofull of great building projects to carry them all out in stone andmarble; we had our frescoes and our shrines to pay for, not to speak ofrapacious condottieri, bribed royalty, and purchased territories, andour façades and spires must needs wait. But what architect can theFrati Minori (the Franciscans) have employed to build that spire forthem? If it had been built in my day, Filippo Brunelleschi orMichelozzo would have devised something of another fashion thanthat—something worthy to crown the church of Arnolfo.”</p><p>At this the Spirit, with a sigh, lets his eyes travel on to the citywalls, and now he dwells on the change there with wonder at thesemodern times. Why have five out of the eleven convenient gates beenclosed? And why, above all, should the towers have been levelled thatwere once a glory and defence? Is the world become so peaceful, then,and do Florentines dwell in such harmony, that there are no longerconspiracies to bring ambitious exiles home again with armed bands attheir back? These are difficult questions: it is easier and pleasanterto recognise the old than to account for the new. And there flows Arno,with its bridges just where they used to be—the Ponte Vecchio, leastlike other bridges in the world, laden with the same quaint shops whereour Spirit remembers lingering a little on his way perhaps to look atthe progress of that great palace which Messer Luca Pitti had seta-building with huge stones got from the Hill of Bogoli (now Boboli)close behind, or perhaps to transact a little business with thecloth-dressers in Oltrarno. The exorbitant line of the Pitti roof ishidden from San Miniato; but the yearning of the old Florentine is notto see Messer Luca’s too ambitious palace which he built unto himself;it is to be down among those narrow streets and busy humming Piazzewhere he inherited the eager life of his fathers. Is not the anxiousvoting with black and white beans still going on down there? Who arethe Priori in these months, eating soberly-regulated official dinnersin the Palazzo Vecchio, with removes of tripe and boiled partridges,seasoned by practical jokes against the ill-fated butt among thosepotent signors? Are not the significant banners still hung from thewindows—still distributed with decent pomp under Orcagna’s Loggia everytwo months?</p><p>Life had its zest for the old Florentine when he, too, trod the marblesteps and shared in those dignities. His politics had an area as wideas his trade, which stretched from Syria to Britain, but they had alsothe passionate intensity, and the detailed practical interest, whichcould belong only to a narrow scene of corporate action; only to themembers of a community shut in close by the hills and by walls of sixmiles’ circuit, where men knew each other as they passed in the street,set their eyes every day on the memorials of their commonwealth, andwere conscious of having not simply the right to vote, but the chanceof being voted for. He loved his honours and his gains, the business ofhis counting-house, of his guild, of the public council-chamber; heloved his enmities too, and fingered the white bean which was to keep ahated name out of the <em>borsa</em> with more complacency than if it had beena golden florin. He loved to strengthen his family by a good alliance,and went home with a triumphant light in his eyes after concluding asatisfactory marriage for his son or daughter under his favouriteloggia in the evening cool; he loved his game at chess under that sameloggia, and his biting jest, and even his coarse joke, as not beneaththe dignity of a man eligible for the highest magistracy. He had gainedan insight into all sorts of affairs at home and abroad: he had been ofthe “Ten” who managed the war department, of the “Eight” who attendedto home discipline, of the Priori or Signori who were the heads of theexecutive government; he had even risen to the supreme office ofGonfaloniere; he had made one in embassies to the Pope and to theVenetians; and he had been commissary to the hired army of theRepublic, directing the inglorious bloodless battles in which no mandied of brave breast wounds—<em>virtuosi colpi</em>—but only of casual fallsand tramplings. And in this way he had learned to distrust men withoutbitterness; looking on life mainly as a game of skill, but not dead totraditions of heroism and clean-handed honour. For the human soul ishospitable, and will entertain conflicting sentiments and contradictoryopinions with much impartiality. It was his pride besides, that he wasduly tinctured with the learning of his age, and judged not altogetherwith the vulgar, but in harmony with the ancients: he, too, in hisprime, had been eager for the most correct manuscripts, and had paidmany florins for antique vases and for disinterred busts of the ancientimmortals—some, perhaps, <em>truncis naribus</em>, wanting as to the nose, butnot the less authentic; and in his old age he had made haste to look atthe first sheets of that fine Homer which was among the early gloriesof the Florentine press. But he had not, for all that, neglected tohang up a waxen image or double of himself under the protection of theMadonna Annunziata, or to do penance for his sins in large gifts to theshrines of saints whose lives had not been modelled on the study of theclassics; he had not even neglected making liberal bequests towardsbuildings for the Frati, against whom he had levelled many a jest.</p><p>For the Unseen Powers were mighty. Who knew—who was sure—that there was<em>any</em> name given to them behind which there was no angry force to beappeased, no intercessory pity to be won? Were not gems medicinal,though they only pressed the finger? Were not all things charged withoccult virtues? Lucretius might be right—he was an ancient, and a greatpoet; Luigi Pulci, too, who was suspected of not believing anythingfrom the roof upward (<em>dal tetto in su</em>), had very much the air ofbeing right over the supper-table, when the wine and jests werecirculating fast, though he was only a poet in the vulgar tongue. Therewere even learned personages who maintained that Aristotle, wisest ofmen (unless, indeed, Plato were wiser?) was a thoroughly irreligiousphilosopher; and a liberal scholar must entertain all speculations. Butthe negatives might, after all, prove false; nay, seemed manifestlyfalse, as the circling hours swept past him, and turned round withgraver faces. For had not the world become Christian? Had he not beenbaptised in San Giovanni, where the dome is awful with symbols ofcoming judgment, and where the altar bears a crucified Image disturbingto perfect complacency in one’s self and the world? Our resuscitatedSpirit was not a pagan philosopher, nor a philosophising pagan poet,but a man of the fifteenth century, inheriting its strange web ofbelief and unbelief; of Epicurean levity and fetichistic dread; ofpedantic impossible ethics uttered by rote, and crude passions actedout with childish impulsiveness; of inclination towards aself-indulgent paganism, and inevitable subjection to that humanconscience which, in the unrest of a new growth, was rilling the airwith strange prophecies and presentiments.</p><p>He had smiled, perhaps, and shaken his head dubiously, as he heardsimple folk talk of a Pope Angelico, who was to come by-and-by andbring in a new order of things, to purify the Church from simony, andthe lives of the clergy from scandal—a state of affairs too differentfrom what existed under Innocent the Eighth for a shrewd merchant andpolitician to regard the prospect as worthy of entering into hiscalculations. But he felt the evils of the time, nevertheless; for hewas a man of public spirit, and public spirit can never be whollyimmoral, since its essence is care for a common good. That veryQuaresima or Lent of 1492 in which he died, still in his erect old age,he had listened in San Lorenzo, not without a mixture of satisfaction,to the preaching of a Dominican Friar, named Girolamo Savonarola, whodenounced with a rare boldness the worldliness and vicious habits ofthe clergy, and insisted on the duty of Christian men not to live fortheir own ease when wrong was triumphing in high places, and not tospend their wealth in outward pomp even in the churches, when theirfellow-citizens were suffering from want and sickness. The Fratecarried his doctrine rather too far for elderly ears; yet it was amemorable thing to see a preacher move his audience to such a pitchthat the women even took off their ornaments, and delivered them up tobe sold for the benefit of the needy.</p><p>“He was a noteworthy man, that Prior of San Marco,” thinks our Spirit;“somewhat arrogant and extreme, perhaps, especially in hisdenunciations of speedy vengeance. Ah, <em>Iddio non paga il Sabatol</em>(‘God does not pay on a Saturday’)—the wages of men’s sins often lingerin their payment, and I myself saw much established wickedness oflong-standing prosperity. But a Frate Predicatore who wanted to movethe people—how could he be moderate? He might have been a little lessdefiant and curt, though, to Lorenzo de’ Medici, whose family had beenthe very makers of San Marco: was that quarrel ever made up? And ourLorenzo himself, with the dim outward eyes and the subtle inwardvision, did he get over that illness at Careggi? It was but a sad,uneasy-looking face that he would carry out of the world which hadgiven him so much, and there were strong suspicions that his handsomeson would play the part of Rehoboam. How has it all turned out? Whichparty is likely to be banished and have its houses sacked just now? Isthere any successor of the incomparable Lorenzo, to whom the great Turkis so gracious as to send over presents of rare animals, rare relics,rare manuscripts, or fugitive enemies, suited to the tastes of aChristian Magnifico who is at once lettered and devout—and alsoslightly vindictive? And what famous scholar is dictating the Latinletters of the Republic—what fiery philosopher is lecturing on Dante inthe Duomo, and going home to write bitter invectives against the fatherand mother of the bad critic who may have found fault with hisclassical spelling? Are our wiser heads leaning towards alliance withthe Pope and the Regno (The name given to Naples by way of distinctionamong the Italian States), or are they rather inclining their ears tothe orators of France and of Milan?</p><p>“There is knowledge of these things to be had in the streets below, onthe beloved <em>marmi</em> in front of the churches, and under the shelteringLoggie, where surely our citizens have still their gossip and debates,their bitter and merry jests as of old. For are not the well-rememberedbuildings all there? The changes have not been so great in thoseuncounted years. I will go down and hear—I will tread the familiarpavement, and hear once again the speech of Florentines.”</p><p>Go not down, good Spirit! for the changes are great and the speech ofFlorentines would sound as a riddle in your ears. Or, if you go, minglewith no politicians on the <em>marmi</em>, or elsewhere; ask no questionsabout trade in the Calimara; confuse yourself with no inquiries intoscholarship, official or monastic. Only look at the sunlight andshadows on the grand walls that were built solidly, and have endured intheir grandeur; look at the faces of the little children, makinganother sunlight amid the shadows of age; look, if you will, into thechurches, and hear the same chants, see the same images as of old—theimages of willing anguish for a great end, of beneficent love andascending glory; see upturned living faces, and lips moving to the oldprayers for help. These things have not changed. The sunlight andshadows bring their old beauty and waken the old heart-strains atmorning, noon, and eventide; the little children are still the symbolof the eternal marriage between love and duty; and men still yearn forthe reign of peace and righteousness—still own <em>that</em> life to be thehighest which is a conscious voluntary sacrifice. For the Pope Angelicois not come yet.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/CYux/GEreader/tree/main/docs/romola/PROEM.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/GEreader/romola/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Table Of Contents</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/GEreader/romola/BOOK I/CHAPTER_I"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">I.
