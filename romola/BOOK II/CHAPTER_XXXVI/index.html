In this chapter, Romola, disillusioned with her life and disappointed in her husband Tito, makes a decision to leave him and start a new life elsewhere. She packs her belongings and disguises herself as a Pinzochera, a religious woman devoted to acts of piety. As she prepares to leave, she recalls her late brother Dino&#x27;s vision and reflects upon the role of visions and religious experiences in the lives of others. Torn between her rationality and her emotional turmoil, Romola ultimately resolves to go ahead with her plan, even as she remains doubtful and uncertain about the path she is choosing.</p><p><strong>Main Characters</strong>:

And Romola, instead of shutting her eyesand ears, had watched the process. The exhaustion consequent on violentemotion is apt to bring a dreamy disbelief in the reality of its cause;and in the evening, when the workmen were gone, Romola took herhand-lamp and walked slowly round amongst the confusion of straw andwooden cases, pausing at every vacant pedestal, every well-known objectlaid prostrate, with a sort of bitter desire to assure herself thatthere was a sufficient reason why her love was gone and the world wasbarren for her. And still, as the evenings came, she went and wentagain; no longer to assure herself, but because this vivifying of painand despair about her father’s memory was the strongest life left toher affections. On the 23rd of December, she knew that the lastpackages were going. She ran to the loggia at the top of the house thatshe might not lose the last pang of seeing the slow wheels move acrossthe bridge.</p><p>It was a cloudy day, and nearing dusk. Arno ran dark and shivering; thehills were mournful; and Florence with its girdling stone towers hadthat silent, tomb-like look, which unbroken shadow gives to a city seenfrom above. Santa Croce, where her father lay, was dark amidst thatdarkness, and slowly crawling over the bridge, and slowly vanishing upthe narrow street, was the white load, like a cruel, deliberate Fatecarrying away her father’s lifelong hope to bury it in an unmarkedgrave. Romola felt less that she was seeing this herself than that herfather was conscious of it as he lay helpless under the imprisoningstones, where her hand could not reach his to tell him that he was notalone.</p><p>She stood still even after the load had disappeared, heedless of thecold, and soothed by the gloom which seemed to cover her like amourning garment and shut out the discord of joy. When suddenly thegreat bell in the palace-tower rang out a mighty peal: not thehammer-sound of alarm, but an agitated peal of triumph; and one afteranother every other bell in every other tower seemed to catch thevibration and join the chorus. And, as the chorus swelled and swelledtill the air seemed made of sound—little flames, vibrating too, as ifthe sound had caught fire, burst out between the turrets of the palaceand on the girdling towers.</p><p>That sudden clang, that leaping light, fell on Romola like sharpwounds. They were the triumph of demons at the success of her husband’streachery, and the desolation of her life. Little more than three weeksago she had been intoxicated with the sound of those very bells; and inthe gladness of Florence, she had heard a prophecy of her own gladness.But now the general joy seemed cruel to her: she stood aloof from thatcommon life—that Florence which was flinging out its loud exultation tostun the ears of sorrow and loneliness. She could never join hands withgladness again, but only with those whom it was in the hard nature ofgladness to forget. And in her bitterness she felt that all rejoicingwas mockery. Men shouted paeans with their souls full of heaviness, andthen looked in their neighbours’ faces to see if there was really sucha thing as joy. Romola had lost her belief in the happiness she hadonce thirsted for: it was a hateful, smiling, soft-handed thing, with anarrow, selfish heart.</p><p>She ran down from the loggia, with her hands pressed against her ears,and was hurrying across the antechamber, when she was startled byunexpectedly meeting her husband, who was coming to seek her.</p><p>His step was elastic, and there was a radiance of satisfaction abouthim not quite usual.</p><p>“What! the noise was a little too much for you?” he said; for Romola,as she started at the sight of him, had pressed her hands all thecloser against her ears. He took her gently by the wrist, and drew herarm within his, leading her into the saloon surrounded with the dancingnymphs and fauns, and then went on speaking: “Florence is gone quitemad at getting its Great Council, which is to put an end to all theevils under the sun; especially to the vice of merriment. You may welllook stunned, my Romola, and you are cold. You must not stay so lateunder that windy loggia without wrappings. I was coming to tell youthat I am suddenly called to Rome about some learned business forBernardo Rucellai. I am going away immediately, for I am to join myparty at San Gaggio to-night, that we may start early in the morning. Ineed give you no trouble; I have had my packages made already. It willnot be very long before I am back again.”</p><p>He knew he had nothing to expect from her but quiet endurance of whathe said and did. He could not even venture to kiss her brow thisevening, but just pressed her hand to his lips, and left her. Tito feltthat Romola was a more unforgiving woman than he had imagined; her lovewas not that sweet clinging instinct, stronger than all judgments,which, he began to see now, made the great charm of a wife. Still, thispetrified coldness was better than a passionate, futile opposition. Herpride and capability of seeing where resistance was useless had theirconvenience.</p><p>But when the door had closed on Tito, Romola lost the look of coldimmobility which came over her like an inevitable frost whenever heapproached her. Inwardly she was very far from being in a state ofquiet endurance, and the days that had passed since the scene which haddivided her from Tito had been days of active planning and preparationfor the fulfilment of a purpose.</p><p>The first thing she did now was to call old Maso to her.</p><p>“Maso,” she said, in a decided tone, “we take our journey to-morrowmorning. We shall be able now to overtake that first convoy of cloth,while they are waiting at San Piero. See about the two mules to-night,and be ready to set off with them at break of day, and wait for me atTrespiano.”</p><p>She meant to take Maso with her as far as Bologna, and then send himback with letters to her godfather and Tito, telling them that she wasgone and never meant to return. She had planned her departure so thatits secrecy might be perfect, and her broken love and life be hiddenaway unscanned by vulgar eyes. Bernardo del Nero had been absent at hisvilla, willing to escape from political suspicions to his favouriteoccupation of attending to his land, and she had paid him the debtwithout a personal interview. He did not even know that the library wassold, and was left to conjecture that some sudden piece of good fortunehad enabled Tito to raise this sum of money. Maso had been taken intoher confidence only so far that he knew her intended journey was asecret; and to do just what she told him was the thing he cared mostfor in his withered wintry age.</p><p>Romola did not mean to go to bed that night. When she had fastened thedoor she took her taper to the carved and painted chest which containedher wedding-clothes. The white silk and gold lay there, the long whiteveil and the circlet of pearls. A great sob rose as she looked at them:they seemed the shroud of her dead happiness. In a tiny gold loop ofthe circlet a sugar-plum had lodged—a pink hailstone from the shower ofsweets: Tito had detected it first, and had said that it should alwaysremain there. At certain moments—and this was one of them—Romola wascarried, by a sudden wave of memory, back again into the time ofperfect trust, and felt again the presence of the husband whose lovemade the world as fresh and wonderful to her as to a little child thatsits in stillness among the sunny flowers: heard the gentle tones andsaw the soft eyes without any lie in them, and breathed again thatlarge freedom of the soul which comes from the faith that the being whois nearest to us is greater than ourselves. And in those brief momentsthe tears always rose: the woman’s lovingness felt something akin towhat the bereaved mother feels when the tiny fingers seem to lie warmon her bosom, and yet are marble to her lips as she bends over thesilent bed.</p><p>But there was something else lying in the chest besides thewedding-clothes: it was something dark and coarse, rolled up in a closebundle. She turned away her eyes from the white and gold to the darkbundle, and as her hands touched the serge, her tears began to bechecked. That coarse roughness recalled her fully to the present, fromwhich love and delight were gone. She unfastened the thick white cordand spread the bundle out on the table. It was the grey serge dress ofa sister belonging to the third order of Saint Francis, living in theworld but especially devoted to deeds of piety—a personage whom theFlorentines were accustomed to call a Pinzochera. Romola was going toput on this dress as a disguise, and she determined to put it on atonce, so that, if she needed sleep before the morning, she might wakeup in perfect readiness to be gone. She put off her black garment, andas she thrust her soft white arms into the harsh sleeves of the sergemantle and felt the hard girdle of rope hurt her fingers as she tiedit, she courted those rude sensations: they were in keeping with hernew scorn of that thing called pleasure which made men base—thatdexterous contrivance for selfish ease, that shrinking from enduranceand strain, when others were bowing beneath burdens too heavy for them,which now made one image with her husband. Then she gathered her longhair together, drew it away tight from her face, bound it in a greathard knot at the back of her head, and taking a square piece of blacksilk, tied it in the fashion of a kerchief close across her head andunder her chin; and over that she drew the cowl. She lifted the candleto the mirror. Surely her disguise would be complete to any one who hadnot lived very near to her. To herself she looked strangely like herbrother Dino: the full oval of the cheek had only to be wasted; theeyes, already sad, had only to become a little sunken. Was she gettingmore like him in anything else? Only in this, that she understood nowhow men could be prompted to rush away for ever from earthly delights,how they could be prompted to dwell on images of sorrow rather than ofbeauty and joy.</p><p>But she did not linger at the mirror: she set about collecting andpacking all the relics of her father and mother that were too large tobe carried in her small travelling-wallet. They were all to be put inthe chest along with her wedding-clothes, and the chest was to becommitted to her godfather when she was safely gone. First she laid inthe portraits; then one by one every little thing that had a sacredmemory clinging to it was put into her wallet or into the chest.</p><p>She paused. There was still something else to be stript away from her,belonging to that past on which she was going to turn her back forever. She put her thumb and her forefinger to her betrothal ring; butthey rested there, without drawing it off. Romola’s mind had beenrushing with an impetuous current towards this act, for which she waspreparing: the act of quitting a husband who had disappointed all hertrust, the act of breaking an outward tie that no longer representedthe inward bond of love. But that force of outward symbols by which ouractive life is knit together so as to make an inexorable externalidentity for us, not to be shaken by our wavering consciousness, gave astrange effect to this simple movement towards taking off her ring—amovement which was but a small sequence of her energetic resolution. Itbrought a vague but arresting sense that she was somehow violentlyrending her life in two: a presentiment that the strong impulse whichhad seemed to exclude doubt and make her path clear might after all beblindness, and that there was something in human bonds which mustprevent them from being broken with the breaking of illusions.</p><p>If that beloved Tito who had placed the betrothal ring on her fingerwas not in any valid sense the same Tito whom she had ceased to love,why should she return to him the sign of their union, and not ratherretain it as a memorial? And this act, which came as a palpabledemonstration of her own and his identity, had a power unexplained toherself, of shaking Romola. It is the way with half the truth amidstwhich we live, that it only haunts us and makes dull pulsations thatare never born into sound. But there was a passionate voice speakingwithin her that presently nullified all such muffled murmurs.</p><p>“It cannot be! I cannot be subject to him. He is false. I shrink fromhim. I despise him!”</p><p>She snatched the ring from her finger and laid it on the table againstthe pen with which she meant to write. Again she felt that there couldbe no law for her but the law of her affections. That tenderness andkeen fellow-feeling for the near and the loved which are the mainoutgrowth of the affections, had made the religion of her life: theyhad made her patient in spite of natural impetuosity: they would havesufficed to make her heroic. But now all that strength was gone, or,rather, it was converted into the strength of repulsion. She hadrecoiled from Tito in proportion to the energy of that young belief andlove which he had disappointed, of that lifelong devotion to her fatheragainst which he had committed an irredeemable offence. And it seemedas if all motive had slipped away from her, except the indignation andscorn that made her tear herself asunder from him.</p><p>She was not acting after any precedent, or obeying any adopted maxims.The grand severity of the stoical philosophy in which her father hadtaken care to instruct her, was familiar enough to her ears and lips,and its lofty spirit had raised certain echoes within her; but she hadnever used it, never needed it as a rule of life. She had endured andforborne because she loved: maxims which told her to feel less, and notto cling close lest the onward course of great Nature should jar her,had been as powerless on her tenderness as they had been on herfather’s yearning for just fame. She had appropriated no theories: shehad simply felt strong in the strength of affection, and life withoutthat energy came to her as an entirely new problem.</p><p>She was going to solve the problem in a way that seemed to her verysimple. Her mind had never yet bowed to any obligation apart frompersonal love and reverence; she had no keen sense of any other humanrelations, and all she had to obey now was the instinct to severherself from the man she loved no longer.</p><p>Yet the unswerving resolution was accompanied with continually varyingphases of anguish. And now that the active preparation for herdeparture was almost finished, she lingered: she deferred writing theirrevocable words of parting from all her little world. The emotions ofthe past weeks seemed to rush in again with cruel hurry, and takepossession even of her limbs. She was going to write, and her handfell. Bitter tears came now at the delusion which had blighted heryoung years, tears very different from the sob of remembered happinesswith which she had looked at the circlet of pearls and the pinkhailstone. And now she felt a tingling shame at the words of ignominyshe had cast, at Tito—“Have you robbed some one else who is _not_dead?” To have had such words wrung from her—to have uttered them toher husband seemed a degradation of her whole life. Hard speech betweenthose who have loved is hideous in the memory, like the sight ofgreatness and beauty sunk into vice and rags.</p><p>That heart-cutting comparison of the present with the past urged itselfupon Romola till it even transformed itself into wretched sensations:she seemed benumbed to everything but inward throbbings, and began tofeel the need of some hard contact. She drew her hands tight along theharsh knotted cord that hung from her waist. She started to her feetand seized the rough lid of the chest: there was nothing else to go in?No. She closed the lid, pressing her hand upon the rough carving, andlocked it.</p><p>Then she remembered that she had still to complete her equipment as aPinzochera. The large leather purse or scarsella, with small coin init, had to be hung on the cord at her waist (her florins and smalljewels, presents from her godfather and cousin Brigida, were safelyfastened within her serge mantle)—and on the other side must hang therosary.</p><p>It did not occur to Romola, as she hung that rosary by her side, thatsomething else besides the mere garb would perhaps be necessary toenable her to pass as a Pinzochera, and that her whole air andexpression were as little as possible like those of a sister whoseeyelids were used to be bent, and whose lips were used to move insilent iteration. Her inexperience prevented her from picturing distantdetails, and it helped her proud courage in shutting out any forebodingof danger and insult. She did not know that any Florentine woman hadever done exactly what she was going to do: unhappy wives often tookrefuge with their friends, or in the cloister, she knew, but both thosecourses were impossible to her; she had invented a lot for herself—togo to the most learned woman in the world, Cassandra Fedele, at Venice,and ask her how an instructed woman could support herself in a lonelylife there.</p><p>She was not daunted by the practical difficulties in the way or thedark uncertainty at the end. Her life could never be happy any more,but it must not, could not, be ignoble. And by a pathetic mixture ofchildish romance with her woman’s trials, the philosophy which hadnothing to do with this great decisive deed of hers had its place inher imagination of the future: so far as she conceived her solitaryloveless life at all, she saw it animated by a proud stoical heroism,and by an indistinct but strong purpose of labour, that she might bewise enough to write something which would rescue her father’s namefrom oblivion. After all, she was only a young girl—this poor Romola,who had found herself at the end of her joys.</p><p>There were other things yet to be done. There was a small key in acasket on the table—but now Romola perceived that her taper was dyingout, and she had forgotten to provide herself with any other light. Ina few moments the room was in total darkness. Feeling her way to thenearest chair, she sat down to wait for the morning.</p><p>Her purpose in seeking the key had called up certain memories which hadcome back upon her during the past week with the new vividness thatremembered words always have for us when we have learned to give them anew meaning. Since the shock of the revelation which had seemed todivide her for ever from Tito, that last interview with Dino had neverbeen for many hours together out of her mind. And it solicited her allthe more, because while its remembered images pressed upon her almostwith the imperious force of sensations, they raised struggling thoughtswhich resisted their influence. She could not prevent herself fromhearing inwardly the dying prophetic voice saying again and again,—“Theman whose face was a blank loosed thy hand and departed; and as hewent, I could see his face, and it was the face of the great Tempter...And thou, Romola, didst wring thy hands and seek for water, and therewas none... and the plain was bare and stony again, and thou wast alonein the midst of it. And then it seemed that the night fell, and I sawno more.” She could not prevent herself from dwelling with a sort ofagonised fascination on the wasted face; on the straining gaze at thecrucifix; on the awe which had compelled her to kneel; on the lastbroken words and then the unbroken silence—on all the details of thedeath-scene, which had seemed like a sudden opening into a world apartfrom that of her lifelong knowledge.</p><p>But her mind was roused to resistance of impressions that, from beingobvious phantoms, seemed to be getting solid in the daylight. As astrong body struggles against fumes with the more violence when theybegin to be stifling, a strong soul struggles against phantasies withall the more alarmed energy when they threaten to govern in the placeof thought.</p><p>What had the words of that vision to do with her real sorrows? Thatfitting of certain words was a mere chance; the rest was all vague—nay,those words themselves were vague; they were determined by nothing buther brother’s memories and beliefs. He believed there was somethingfatal in pagan learning; he believed that celibacy was more holy thanmarriage; he remembered their home, and all the objects in the library;and of these threads the vision was woven. What reasonable warrantcould she have had for believing in such a vision and acting on it?None. True as the voice of foreboding had proved, Romola saw withunshaken conviction that to have renounced Tito in obedience to awarning like that, would have been meagre-hearted folly. Her trust hadbeen delusive, but she would have chosen over again to have acted on itrather than be a creature led by phantoms and disjointed whispers in aworld where there was the large music of reasonable speech, and thewarm grasp of living hands.</p><p>But the persistent presence of these memories, linking themselves inher imagination with her actual lot, gave her a glimpse ofunderstanding into the lives which had before lain utterly aloof fromher sympathy—the lives of the men and women who were led by such inwardimages and voices.</p><p>“If they were only a little stronger in me,” she said to herself, “Ishould lose the sense of what that vision really was, and take it for aprophetic light. I might in time get to be a seer of visions myself,like the Suora Maddalena, and Camilla Rucellai, and the rest.”</p><p>Romola shuddered at the possibility. All the instruction, all the maininfluences of her life had gone to fortify her scorn of that sicklysuperstition which led men and women, with eyes too weak for thedaylight, to sit in dark swamps and try to read human destiny by thechance flame of wandering vapours.</p><p>And yet she was conscious of something deeper than that coincidence ofwords which made the parting contact with her dying brother live anewin her mind, and gave a new sisterhood to the wasted face. If therewere much more of such experience as his in the world, she would liketo understand it—would even like to learn the thoughts of men who sankin ecstasy before the pictured agonies of martyrdom. There seemed to besomething more than madness in that supreme fellowship with suffering.The springs were all dried up around her; she wondered what otherwaters there were at which men drank and found strength in the desert.And those moments in the Duomo when she had sobbed with a mysteriousmingling of rapture and pain, while Fra Girolamo offered himself awilling sacrifice for the people, came back to her as if they had beena transient taste of some such far-off fountain. But again she shrankfrom impressions that were alluring her within the sphere of visionsand narrow fears which compelled men to outrage natural affections asDino had done.</p><p>This was the tangled web that Romola had in her mind as she sat wearyin the darkness. No radiant angel came across the gloom with a clearmessage for her. In those times, as now, there were human beings whonever saw angels or heard perfectly clear messages. Such truth as cameto them was brought confusedly in the voices and deeds of men not atall like the seraphs of unfailing wing and piercing vision—men whobelieved falsities as well as truths, and did the wrong as well as theright.
